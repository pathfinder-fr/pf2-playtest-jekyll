You use your occult lore and the power of your mind to manipulate the spiritual multiverse, resulting in any of the following effects:

- Duplicate any occult spell of 9th level or lower.

- Duplicate any non-occult spell of 7th level or lower.

- Produce any effect whose power is equivalent to any occult spell 9th level or lower, or non-occult spell 7th level or lower. At the GM's discretion, you can try to produce greater effects, but this is dangerous and the spell may have only a partial effect.

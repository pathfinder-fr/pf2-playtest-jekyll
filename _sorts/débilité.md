You drastically reduce the target’s mental faculties. The effect depends on the target’s Will save.

**Réussite** The target is stupefied 2 for 1 round.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target is stupefied 4 with a permanent duration.

**Échec critique** The target’s intellect is permanently reduced below that of an animal, and it treats its Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom modifiers as –5. It loses all class abilities that require mental faculties, including all spellcasting. If the target is a PC, she becomes an NPC under the GM’s control.

9th

You can target a non-humanoid creature.

summary: '..'
---
The target appears to fall down dead, though it actually turns invisible. Its illusory corpse remains where it fell, complete with an appropriate fatal wound. This illusion looks and feels like a dead body. If the target’s death seems absurd—for instance, a barbarian at full health appears to be slain by 2 damage—the GM can grant the attacker an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the illusion. If the target acts hostile, the spell is dismissed afterward. This ends the entire spell, so the illusory corpse disappears too.

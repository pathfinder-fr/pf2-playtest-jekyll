summary: '..'
---
You revel in your target’s pain. If you succeed at a touch attack, your target takes 1d6 mental damage (double damage on a critical hit) and becomes sick with pain depending on its Will save. As long as the target is sick, you gain a +1 conditional bonus to attack rolls and skill checks against the target.

**Réussite** The target does not become sick.

**Échec** The target is sick 1 and takes 1 persistent mental damage as long as it’s sick.

**Échec critique** Per failure, but the target is sick 2.

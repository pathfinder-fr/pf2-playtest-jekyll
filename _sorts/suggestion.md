summary: '..'
---
You suggest a course of action to the target, which must be phrased in such a way as to seem like a logical course of action to the target and can’t be self-destructive or obviously against the target’s self-interest. The target’s response depends on its Will save.

**Réussite** The target is unaffected and thinks you were talking to them normally, not casting a spell on them.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected and knows you tried to control it.

**Échec** The target immediately follows your suggestion. The spell has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target has completed a finite suggestion or the suggestion becomes self-destructive or has other obvious negative effects, at which point the spell is dismissed.

**Échec critique** Per failure, but the duration is 1 hour or until dismissed.

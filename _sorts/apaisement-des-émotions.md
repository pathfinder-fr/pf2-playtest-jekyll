Creatures in the area become calm, depending on their Will saves.

**Réussite** Calming urges give a –1 conditional penalty to attack rolls.

**Réussite critique** The creature is unaffected.

**Échec** You suppress emotion effects and prevent the creature from acting hostile. If it is subject to hostility from any other creature, it ceases to be affected by calm emotions.

**Échec critique** As failure, but hostility doesn't end the effect.

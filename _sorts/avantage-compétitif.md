Your competitiveness drives you to better yourself against superior opposition. You gain a +1 conditional bonus to checks against a DC more than 11 greater than your total bonus before competitive edge; this doesn't affect your DCs. For instance, if you attempt a check at a +10 against a DC of 22 or higher, you gain the bonus, but if the DC is 21 or lower, you don't.

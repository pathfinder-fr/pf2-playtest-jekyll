---
A vision of apocalyptic destruction fills the mind of each target. Each creature in the area sees its own version of the calamity tailored to its worst fears, and must attempt a Will saving throw. This vision deals 11d6 mental damage and inflicts other effects, depending on the outcome of each creature’s saving throw. It must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or believe it’s trapped (fallen into a crevasse, adrift at sea, or some other fate depending on its vision). If it fails, it’s stunned for 1 minute. It gets a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, it disbelieves the illusion and recovers from stunned.

**Réussite** Half damage.

**Réussite critique** Unaffected.

**Échec** Full damage.

**Échec critique** Double damage and the creature falls prone.

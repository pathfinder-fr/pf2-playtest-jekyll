You inflict despair on creatures in the area. The effects are determined for each creature by its Will save.

**Réussite** For 1 round, it can't take reactions and must attempt another save at the start of its turn or be slowed 1 for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.

**Réussite critique** The creature is unaffected.

**Échec** As a success, but lasting 1 minute.

**Échec critique** As failure, but automatically slowed 1 for 1 minute.

The target is overcome with an all-consuming urge to dance, depending on its Will save. For the duration of the spell, the target is flat-footed and can’t use reactions. While affected, the creature can’t use any move actions other than to dance by using the Stride action to move up to half its Speed.

**Réussite** The spell’s duration is 3 rounds, and the target must spend at least 1 action per turn dancing.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The spell’s duration is 1 minute, and the target must spend at least 2 actions per turn dancing.

**Échec critique** The spell’s duration is 1 minute, and the target must spend all its actions each turn dancing.

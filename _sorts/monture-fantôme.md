---
You conjure a Large, magical, horselike creature that only you (or another Medium or Small creature you choose when casting the spell) can ride. The horse is clearly phantasmal in nature, has 18 AC and 10 Hit Points, and automatically fails all saves. If reduced to 0 Hit Points, it disappears and the spell is dismissed. The steed has a Speed of 40 feet and can hold your body weight (or the body weight of the creature you chose) plus 20 Bulk.

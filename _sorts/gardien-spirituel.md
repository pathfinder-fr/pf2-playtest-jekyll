A Medium guardian made of pure magical force manifests and attacks foes you designate within range. This guardian is ghostly and translucent and appears to be holding your deity’s favored weapon. When you cast the spell, the spiritual guardian appears in an unoccupied space next to a foe of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Concentrate on the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied space next to a new target within range (if you choose to do so and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Concentrate on the Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 30 Hit Points and can’t recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can’t take damage except when protecting an ally, though disintegrate automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian’s TAC of 25. Attacks with the guardian use your attack modifier with that type of weapon but use your spellcasting ability modifier instead of the normal ability modifier. Regardless of the weapon’s appearance, the guardian deals force damage equal to 1d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. When you Strike with the guardian, you can choose to deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon it holds instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No other attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A spiritual guardian’s weapon counts as a weapon for triggers, resistances, and so forth. The guardian takes up space and grants flanking (even with a ranged weapon), but it doesn’t have any other attributes a creature would normally have, aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The guardian can’t make any kind of attack other than a normal Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to the guardian’s attacks.

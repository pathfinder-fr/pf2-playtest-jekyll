Animals, plants and weather in the area turn against the targets. Each target suffers from the following effects.

- Vegetation springs up from any surface, making targets entangled any time they’re adjacent to a plant or a surface of stone or earth.

- Aggressive animals attack unpredictably then depart. At the start of its turn, each target rolls a DC 8 flat check. On a failure, it’s attacked by swarming creatures that deal 2d10 slashing damage. The target can attempt a Reflex save, taking half damage on a success, no damage on a critical success, or double damage on a critical failure. The target is flat-footed for 1 round on any result other than a critical success.

- The target also loses any connection to nature or natural creatures. Any animal or plant creature becomes hostile to it, even a companion creature like an animal companion. The target also has to succeed at a DC 5 flat check when casting any primal spell or the spell fails. The GM might determine that you can’t subject some creatures to the ire of nature. For example, a primal spellcaster of your level or higher or an avatar of nature might be immune to these effects.

Your Somatic Casting action for this spell is a swing with one weapon you’re holding that you’re trained with, so you can use the Somatic Casting action even if you don’t have a hand free. The weapon magically multiplies into duplicates that swipe at all creatures in either a cone or an aura, dealing four dice of damage to creatures in the area. This damage has the same type as the chosen weapon and uses the same die size. Determine the die size as if you were attacking with the weapon; for instance, if you were wielding a two-hand weapon in both hands, you’d use its two-hand damage die. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

**Réussite** Half damage.

**Réussite critique** Unaffected.

**Échec** Full damage.

**Échec critique** Double damage, plus the weapon’s critical specialization effect.

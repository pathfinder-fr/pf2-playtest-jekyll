You and all targets are invisible except to each other as long as you remain within the spell’s area. If a creature made invisible by this spell leaves the spell’s area, it becomes visible and remains so even if it returns to the spell’s area. If any creature made invisible by this spell acts in a hostile manner, the spell is dismissed after that hostile action, reaction, free action, or activity is completed. While exploring, it’s easy to move together and remain invisible. This is untenable in a battle, however. Once an encounter begins, creatures remain invisible until the end of the first round, at which point the spell ends.

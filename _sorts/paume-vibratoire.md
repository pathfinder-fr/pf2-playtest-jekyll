Make a melee unarmed Strike, dealing damage normally. If you succeed and the target is alive; any time during the duration you can spend a Verbal action to speak a word of death that could instantly slay it, depending on its Fortitude save. If you cast quivering palm again, any previous quivering palm you had cast ends.

**Réussite** The target survives, the spell ends, and the target is bolstered against it.

**Échec** The target is stunned for 1 round but survives. The spell’s duration continues, but the target is bolstered against being killed by quivering palm for 24 hours.

**Échec critique** The target dies.

summary: '..'
---
You create a visible tunnel through the wall in the chosen area, replacing the area with empty space; if the wall is thicker than 10 feet, the tunnel ends 10 feet in. Even a small layer of metal in the wall prevents this spell from functioning. This spell doesn’t reduce the integrity of the structure, so the wall doesn’t collapse even if it’s load-bearing. When the spell ends, anyone inside the tunnel is shunted to the nearest exit.

The tunnel can be up to 20 feet deep. The areas of the wall that contain your tunnel’s entrance (and exit, if applicable) appear completely normal (unless subjected to true seeing), despite the tunnel’s existence. The tunnel’s entrance normally counts as a solid wall, but you can specify a password or a trigger stimulus. Anyone speaking the password or fulfilling the trigger stimulus can enter the tunnel freely.

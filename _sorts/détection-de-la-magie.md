---
You send out a magical pulse that registers the presence of magic. You receive no information beyond presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore magic you're fully aware of, such as you and your allies' magic items and ongoing spells. You detect illusion magic only if that magic's effect has a lower level than the level of your detect magic spell. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically get detected normally.

Heightened

-

3rd

You learn the school of magic for the highest level magical effect within range that the spell detects. If multiple effects are equally strong, the GM determines which you learn.

4th

As 3rd level, but you also pinpoint the source of the highest-level magic. You don't learn the exact location but can narrow down the source to within a 5-foot cube. If the source is larger than that, you identify only the cube nearest to you.

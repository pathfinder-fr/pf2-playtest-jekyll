You form a direct connection with your divine source and request intercession. Your divine source always refuses a request out of line with its nature and might choose to grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A miracle can do any of the following things.

- Duplicate any divine spell of 9th level or lower.

- Duplicate any non-divine spell of 7th level or lower.

- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. The GM might allow you to try using miracle to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the spell may have only a partial effect.

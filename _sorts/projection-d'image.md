---
You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can’t see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you Cast a Spell other than an aura spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it can’t truly benefit from spells, though any visual manifestations of the spell appear. The image has AC equal to your TAC and the same saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.

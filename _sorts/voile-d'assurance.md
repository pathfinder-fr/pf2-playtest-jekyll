You surround yourself in a veil of confidence, causing fear to slide off you as long as the veil lasts. Reduce your current frightened condition by 1, and whenever you would become frightened during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you critically fail a saving throw against a fear effect during the duration, veil of confidence ends immediately and you increase the frightened condition you gain from the critical failure by 1 instead of decreasing it.

summary: '..'
---
You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only the spell’s target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target’s Will saving throw.

**Réussite** The target is frightened 1.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target takes 8d6 mental damage and is frightened 2.

**Échec critique** The target is so afraid it might instantly die. It must attempt a Fortitude saving throw; if the target fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and dies. On a successful Fortitude save, the target still takes 12d6 mental damage, is fleeing until the end of its next turn, and is frightened 4.

The damage on a failure increases by 2d6 and on a critical failure by 3d6.

summary: '..'
---
You mouth words, but instead of coming out of your mouth, they’re transferred to the ears of the target. Though others cannot hear your words, the target can as if she were standing next to you. She can give a brief response as a reaction, or as a free action on her next turn if she wishes, but she must be able to see you and be within range to do so. If she responds, per the original missive only you can hear her response.

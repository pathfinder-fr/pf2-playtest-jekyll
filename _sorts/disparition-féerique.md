You can ignore natural difficult terrain (such as underbrush). Once this spell comes into effect, you can immediately Step or Stride. If you have a pool of Spell Points, you can increase the cost of fey disappearance by 2 Spell Points to also turn invisible for the spell’s duration, before taking your Step or Stride. Acting in a hostile manner doesn’t dismiss this invisibility.

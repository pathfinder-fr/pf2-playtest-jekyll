summary: '..'
---
You shrink the target to roughly the size of a coin. This reduces it to negligible Bulk. You can dismiss the spell with a Verbal Casting action or by tossing the object onto a solid surface. The object can’t be used to attack or cause damage when it returns to normal size. If there isn’t room for the object to return to normal size when the spell ends, the spell’s duration continues until the object is in a location large enough to accommodate its normal size.

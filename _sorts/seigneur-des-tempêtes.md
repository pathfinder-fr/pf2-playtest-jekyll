---
The sky above you darkens in a matter of moments, swirling with ominous clouds punctuated by flashes of lighting. Each round when you concentrate on this spell, you can select one of the following effects to occur in the area. In addition, once per round you can use a Somatic Casting action to call down a bolt of lightning from above, striking any target in range that you can see. You deal 10d6 electricity damage to the target, depending on their Reflex save. If you cast this spell underground or inside a structure, it has no effect.

Calm

No additional effect.

Fog

Heavy fog rolls in, concealing the area per obscuring mist.

Rain

Torrential rain falls from the clouds above, dousing ordinary flames. Creatures in the area take a –2 penalty to Acrobatics and Perception checks.

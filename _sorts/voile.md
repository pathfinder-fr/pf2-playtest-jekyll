summary: '..'
---
You disguise the targets as other creatures of the same body shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds). The disguise can hide the targets’ identities or let them appear to be of another ancestry, but it’s not good enough to impersonate specific individuals. The spell doesn’t change voice, scent, or mannerisms. You choose the disguise for each target, so you could make one appear to be a dwarf and another an elf, for example. Casting veil counts as setting up a disguise for the purpose of the Impersonate action. It ignores any circumstance penalties the targets might take for being disguised as a dissimilar creature, and it also gives the targets a +4 conditional bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through their disguises. You can dismiss any or all of these disguises with a Verbal Casting action.

You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges, depending on the target’s Will save.

**Réussite** Per failure, but the curse (and any persistent force damage from the curse) ends on its own after 1 minute.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 1d12 persistent force damage, and each time she takes persistent force damage from spellwrack she reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting her by 1 round. An Arcana check at spellwrack’s DC is required to lower the DC of the flat check for the persistent damage from 20 to 15.

**Échec critique** Per failure, but the persistent force damage is 2d12.

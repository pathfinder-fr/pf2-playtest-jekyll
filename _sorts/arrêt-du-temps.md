You temporarily stop time for everything but you, allowing you to use an incredible number of actions in a short period of time. Immediately after casting time stop, you can use up to 9 actions in three sets of up to 3 actions each. After each set of actions, 1 round passes, but only for you, effects specifically targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable to your attacks, and you can’t target or affect them with anything. Once you have finished your actions, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world. If you had created an effect whose duration extends past the end of the spell, such as a wall of fire, it immediately affects others again as normal, though it doesn’t have any of the effects that normally happen when you first cast the spell.

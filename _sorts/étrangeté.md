You fill the targets’ minds with terrifying images of fearsome creatures, each drawn from the target’s worst fears. Only the targets can see their assailants. For each target, the effects of the weird are based on the target’s Will saving throw. It must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. On a successful Fortitude save, the target still takes the effects of Failure above and is fleeing until the end of its next turn. If if fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and dies.

**Réussite** Unaffected.

**Échec** The target takes 16d6 mental damage and is frightened 2.

**Échec critique** The target is so afraid, it might instantly die.

You strengthen a target's ambition, increase its resentment of allies, and make it easier to turn. The effects depend on its Will save.

**Réussite** Attempts to Coerce, Request, or use mental effects to convince the target to advance its own ambitions take half the usual circumstance penalties (or gain bonuses on the target's save) for being against the target's convictions or nature.

**Réussite critique** The target takes no effect.

**Échec** Attempts to Coerce, Request, or use mental effects to convince the target to advance its own ambitions ignore any circumstance penalties (or bonuses on the target's save) for being against the target's convictions or nature, and they seem reasonable for effects like suggestion.

**Échec critique** The target is overcome with ambition, taking whatever actions would advance its own agenda over that of its allies, even without attempts to convince the target.

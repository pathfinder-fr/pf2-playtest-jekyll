Your encouraging words inspire your ally to succeed at a task. You count as having taken sufficient preparatory actions to Aid your ally on a skill check of your choice, regardless of the circumstances. When you take the Aid reaction to aid that ally on the chosen skill check, you can roll Performance instead of the normal check, and if you would fail or critically fail to Aid, you succeed instead. If you have legendary proficiency in Performance, you instead automatically critically succeed. The GM might rule that you can’t use this ability if the act of encouraging your ally would interfere with the ally’s skill check (like encouraging an ally to Sneak quietly, Lie to the king, or maintain a disguise).

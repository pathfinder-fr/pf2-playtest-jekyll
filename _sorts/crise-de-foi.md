You assault the target's faith, riddling the creature with doubt and mental turmoil for 6d4 mental damage, or 6d6 mental damage if it can cast divine spells. The effects are determined by its Will save. To many deities, casting this spell on a follower of your own deity without significant cause is anathema.

**Réussite** The target takes half damage.

**Réussite critique** The target takes no damage.

**Échec** The target takes full damage.

**Échec critique** The target takes double damage and can't cast divine spells for 1 round.

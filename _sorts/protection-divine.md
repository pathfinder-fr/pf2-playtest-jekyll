Redirect damage no more than twice your level to you. You take the damage instead of the triggering ally. Your immunities, resistances, weaknesses, and so on do not apply against the redirected damage. If the damaging effect applies enhancements or conditions, you arenâ€™t subject to either; your ally is still subject to enhancements and conditions even if you redirect all damage to you.

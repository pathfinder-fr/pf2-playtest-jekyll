The targets enter the edge of the Shadow Plane, where it borders the Material Plane. Targets can’t see the Material Plane while on the Shadow Plane, and while on the Shadow Plane, they are exposed to potential encounters with that plane’s denizens. The shadows on the border between the planes bend space, speeding up your movement with respect to the Material Plane. Every 3 minutes the targets travel along this border, they move as far as they would through the Material Plane in 1 hour. At any point, a target can dismiss the spell’s effects, although this affects only that target. The shadow bending is inexact, so when the spell ends, the targets appear roughly 1 mile from their intended location on the Material Plane (though those who are traveling together appear together).

You pronounce a wish, making your greatest desire come true. A wish spell can produce any one of the following effects.

- Duplicate any arcane spell of 9th level or lower.

- Duplicate any non-arcane spell of 7th level or lower.

- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. The GM might allow you to try using wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so might be dangerous or the spell might have only a partial effect.

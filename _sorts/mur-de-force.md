---
You form an invisible wall of pure magical force up to 50 feet across and up to 20 feet high. The wall has no discernible thickness. If the wall’s surface would be broken by any creature or object, the spell is lost. The wall has AC 10, TAC 6, and Hardness 23, and it can take 3 additional Dents before being broken. If the wall is broken, the spell ends. The wall blocks physical effects from passing through it, and because it’s made of force, it blocks incorporeal and ethereal creatures as well. Teleportation effects can pass through the barrier, as can visual effects (since the wall is invisible). Wall of force is immune to dispelling effects of its level or lower, but the wall is automatically destroyed by a disintegrate spell of any level or by contact with a sphere of annihilation or rod of cancellation.

You create an invisible eye sensor, as if you had cast clairvoyance. When created, this eye must be either in your line of sight or within 1 foot of a surface you touch (such as on the other side of a door). If you have a pool of Spell Points, when the spell’s duration ends, you can spend 1 Spell Point as a free action to extend the duration for another minute.

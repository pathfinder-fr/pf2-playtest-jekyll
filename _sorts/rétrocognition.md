This spell allows you to gain impressions from past events that occurred in your current location. Retrocognition reveals impressions from events that occurred over the course of the last day throughout the first minute of the duration, followed by impressions from the next day back the next minute you concentrate, and so on. If you witness a traumatic or turbulent event through an impression, you lose concentration on the spell unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC of 30–35, depending on the severity of the event. The GM determines whether an event is traumatic and chooses the DC.

8th

You gain impressions of events that occurred over the previous year for each minute you concentrate, instead of the previous day, though the details diminish, making it harder to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events.

9th

You gain impressions of events that occurred over the previous century for each minute you concentrate, instead of the previous day, though the details diminish, making it almost impossible to distinguish impressions from all but the most major events.

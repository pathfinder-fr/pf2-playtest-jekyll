---
You create either a 1-foot-thick, 60-foot-long, 10-foot-high wall of ice in a straight line (the wall doesn’t have to be vertical but it must be anchored on both sides to a solid surface) or a 1-footthick, 10-foot hemisphere of ice. The ice that makes up the wall is opaque. If you wish, the wall can be of a smaller length, height, or radius. You must evoke the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, TAC 8, and Hardness 13. Each section is immune to cold and water. A section also has weakness to fire 15 a section of the wall broken by fire is completely destroyed immediately, melting and evaporating into water and steam. A section broken or destroyed by means other than fire can be moved through as difficult terrain and deals 2d6 cold damage to anyone passing through it.

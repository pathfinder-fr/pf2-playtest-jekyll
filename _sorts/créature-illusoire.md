---
You create an illusory image of a Huge or smaller creature. It makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. If you and the image are ever farther than 500 feet apart, the spell ends. The image can’t speak, but you can use your actions to speak through the creature, with the spell disguising your voice as appropriate. You might need to attempt a Deception or Performance check to convincingly mimic the creature, as determined by the GM. This is especially likely if you’re trying to imitate a specific person and engage with someone that person knows. In combat, the illusion counts as a creature for flanking. It uses your spell roll for attack rolls and saving throws and your spell DC for its AC. If the image is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell is dismissed. The creature has two actions per turn, which it takes when you Concentrate on the Spell. The illusion can’t directly affect the physical world, though its attacks can cause damage by making the target believe they’re real. If the illusory creature hits with a Strike, the target takes mental damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This is a mental effect. The illusion’s Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn’t correspond to the image of the monster—for example, if a Large dragon dealt only 5 damage— the GM might allow the target to attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the spell as a free action. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not suppress regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion. When a creature disbelieves the illusion, it recovers from half the damage it had taken from it (if any) and doesn’t take any further damage from it. The GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.

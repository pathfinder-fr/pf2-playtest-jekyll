You transform into an avatar of your deity, assuming a Huge battle form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. You count as a deity in addition to your normal traits. Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate it. When you transform, you gain the following:

- AC 42 (TAC 39), ignore armor's check penalty and reduced Speed.

- One or more attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +31 and the damage bonus is listed. Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purposes of enfeebled, for example) unless they have the finesse trait, and all ranged attacks are Dexterity based. They target the enemy's AC. Even if they deal positive or negative damage, they don't heal creatures.

- 30 temporary Hit Points while you have the form.

- Darkvision.

- Athletics bonus of +31 unless your own bonus is higher. These statistics can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. This form prevents spellcasting and most manipulate actions that require hands (the GM decides if there's doubt). You can dismiss the spell with a concentrate action. When in battle form, you gain the attacks, Speeds, and special abilities listed for your deity below.

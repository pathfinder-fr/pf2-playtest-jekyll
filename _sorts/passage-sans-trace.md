You reduce the tracks you leave behind, adding a +4 conditional bonus to the DC needed to track you, or setting the DC of tracking you equal to the spell’s DC, whichever is higher. You can gain only one of these two benefits; casting pass without trace multiple times doesn’t improve the DC further.

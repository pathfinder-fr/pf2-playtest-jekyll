A spray of rainbow light beams cascades from your open hand. Each creature in the area must roll 1d8 on the table below to see which beam affects it, then roll a saving throw of the indicated type. The table notes any additional traits that apply to each type of ray. If a creature is struck by multiple beams, it uses the same d20 result for all its saving throws. For all rays, a successful saving throw negates the effect for that creature.

1d8||Color||Save||Effect (Traits)

1||Red||Reflex||30 fire damage (fire)

2||Orange||Reflex||40 acid damage (acid)

3||Yellow||Reflex||50 electricity damage (electricity)

4||Green||Fortitude||20 poison damage and enfeebled 1 for 1 minute (poison)

5||Blue||Fortitude||Affected as if by flesh to stone

6||Indigo||Will||Confused, per the warp mind spell (mental)

7||Violet||Will||Slowed 1 for 1 minute sent to another plane, per plane shift, on a critical failure (teleportation)

8||Potent beam||—||Affected by two beams— roll twice, rerolling any duplicates or 8s

You send a message to your target’s dream. The message is oneway, up to 1 minute of speech (roughly 150 words). If the target is asleep, she receives the message instantly. If not, she receives it the next time she sleeps. As soon as she receives it, the spell is dismissed, and you know the message was sent.

You can target up to 10 creatures you know by name and have met in person. You must send the same message to all of them; the spell is dismissed for each creature individually.

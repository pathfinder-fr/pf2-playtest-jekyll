summary: '..'
---
You create a 5-foot-thick, 60-foot-long, and 10-foot-high wall of brambles and thorns in a straight line. The wall stands vertically. If you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or height. Everything on each side of the wall has cover from creatures on the opposite side, and the wall’s space counts as difficult terrain. For every move action a creature uses that enters at least one of the wall’s spaces, that creature takes 3d4 piercing damage. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall has AC 10, TAC 6, and Hardness 9. A broken section can be moved through freely.

The Hardness of each section of the wall increases by 2 and the piercing damage increases by 1d4.

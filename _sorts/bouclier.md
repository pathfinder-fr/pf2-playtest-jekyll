You raise a magical shield of force to protect you. This counts as using the Raise a Shield action (see the sidebar) to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, though it doesn’t require a hand to use. While the spell is in effect, you can also use the Shield Block reaction with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 4. After you use Shield Block, the spell is dismissed and you can’t cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell’s reaction against the magic missile spell. Heightening the spell increases the Hardness.

You focus all your divine energy into transforming yourself into a battle form, similar to your normal form but armed with powerful divine armaments granted by your deity. Your gear is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate any items. When you transform, you gain the following.

- AC 27 (Touch 24) and ignore your armor’s check penalty and Speed reduction

- A special attack with a righteous armament version of your favored weapon, which is the only type of attack you can use. When attacking with the special weapon, your attack modifier is +20 and your damage bonus is +4 (or +2 for a ranged attack). Use four of your weapon’s normal damage dice, or one damage die higher if your weapon is a simple weapon with a d4 or d6 damage die. The weapon has one of the following properties that matches your deity’s alignment: anarchic, axiomatic, holy, unholy. If your deity is true neutral, you instead gain access to the weapon’s critical specialization effect.

- 10 temporary Hit Points that go away when you leave your battle form.

- Resistance 3 against physical damage.

- Darkvision.

- Speed of 40 feet.

- Athletics +20 unless your own total modifier is higher. The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents you from casting spells or using most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you can spend if there’s doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait).

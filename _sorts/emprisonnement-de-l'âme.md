---
You wrench the target's soul and imprison it in a black sapphire. The soul can't be returned to life through any means, even a miracle or wish. If the gem is destroyed or soul bind is dispelled on the gem, the soul is free. The gem has AC 16, TAC 12, and Hardness 10. A gem can't hold more than one soul, and attempting to put another soul into it wastes the spell.

You transform yourself into any form you could choose with a different polymorph spell you know of 7th level or lower. You choose the type of creature as you cast the spell rather than when you prepare it. You can Concentrate on the Spell to change your form to any other form you could choose with this spell. You can dismiss this spell by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait).

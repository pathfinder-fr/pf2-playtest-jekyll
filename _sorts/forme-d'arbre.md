You transform into a Large tree. Perception checks don’t reveal your true nature, but a successful Nature or Survival check against your spell DC reveals that the tree is new to the area. While in tree form, you can observe everything around you, but you can’t act other than by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait) to end the spell, which ends your turn. As a tree, your AC is 20; your TAC is 12; and only conditional bonuses, conditional penalties, circumstance bonuses, and circumstance penalties affect you. You treat successes and critical successes on Reflex saves as failures.

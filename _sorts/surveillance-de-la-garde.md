You tap into the pulse of the city and its wardens, gaining knowledge of their movements. You instantly learn the location of the nearest openly visible city guard activity within the city, outside the regular patrols and activities, and the spell ends. If the city guard isnâ€™t currently engaged in such an activity, the spell reports the next one that occurs during the duration and the spell ends.

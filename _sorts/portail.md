You tear open a rift to another plane, creating a portal that creatures can use to travel both ways for the duration. This portal is vertical and circular, with a radius of 40 feet. The gate appears at a location of your choice on the destination plane, assuming you have a clear idea of both the destinationâ€™s location on the plane and what the destination looks like. If you attempt to create a gate into or out of the realm of deity or another powerful being, that being can prevent the gate from forming.

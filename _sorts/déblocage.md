You make the target easier to open. Knock grants any who try to open the target a +4 conditional bonus to any Thievery or Athletics checks to do so. You can attempt a Thievery check to open the target as part of casting knock. As soon as the target is opened or unlocked, the spell is dismissed. Knock dispels lock.

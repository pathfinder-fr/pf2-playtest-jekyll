---
Your litany rails against the sin of wrath, punishing the target for attacking good creatures depending on its Reflex save. A particularly wrathful creature, such as a vrock, treats the outcome of the saving throw as one degree of success worse. The target is bolstered against your litanies.

**Réussite** The first time the target spends an action or performs an activity that damages at least one good creature, it takes 3d6 good damage.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** Each time the target spends an action or performs an activity that damages at least one good creature, it takes 3d6 good damage.

A field of vibrant, ever-changing colors manifests in the air. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by the pattern doesn’t need to attempt new saves.

**Réussite** Unaffected.

**Échec** The target is confused for 1d4 rounds.

**Échec critique** The target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. After the stun ends, the target is confused for the remaining duration of the spell.

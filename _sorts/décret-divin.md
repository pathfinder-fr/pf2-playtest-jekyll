You utter potent words linked to your faith. Choose an alignment your deity has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful). You can’t cast this spell if you don’t have a deity or your deity is true neutral. You deal 7d6 damage to creatures in the area; each creature must attempt a Will save. Creatures that match the alignment are unaffected. Those that neither match nor oppose it don’t suffer effects other than damage and treat their result as one degree better.

**Réussite** The creature takes half damage.

**Réussite critique** The creature is unaffected.

**Échec** It takes full damage and is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute.

**Échec critique** It takes double damage and is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute. A 10th-level creature or lower must attempt a second save. On a failure, it’s paralyzed for 1 minute; on a critical failure, it dies. If you’re on your home plane, a creature that critically fails is banished with the effect of a failed banishment save.

Heightened

1

The damage increases by 1d6 and the level of creatures that must attempt a second save on a critical failure by 2.

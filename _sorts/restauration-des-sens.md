You can counteract a single effect making the target blinded or deafened. This can counteract both temporary magic and permanent consequences of magic, but it doesn’t cure someone who is missing the sense from some natural state or effect, such as from birth or from a nonmagical wound or toxin.

The spell’s range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures. You can choose the effect to counteract separately for each selected creature.

summary: '..'
---
To the target, your words are honey and your visage bathed in dreamy haze. It must attempt a Will save, with a +4 circumstance bonus if you or your allies recently threatened it or acted hostile. You can dismiss charm with a Verbal Casting action. If you act hostile to the target, the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target doesn't necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations, which could potentially allow you to convince the target to continue being your friend via mundane means.

**Réussite** The target is unaffected, but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of charm, unless it identifies the spell (usually with Identify Magic).

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected and aware you tried to charm it.

**Échec** The target's attitude becomes friendly toward you. If it was friendly, it becomes helpful. It can't act hostile toward you.

**Échec critique** Target is helpful and can't act hostile toward you.

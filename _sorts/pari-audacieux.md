If the triggering saving throw’s result is a success, it counts as a critical success. If it’s a failure, it counts as a critical failure, and the critical failure can’t be reduced by abilities that usually reduce critical failure, such as improved evasion. If the triggering ability did not have both a critical success and critical failure condition, tempt fate fails and your Spell Point is refunded.

summary: '..'
---
You step into a living tree with a trunk large enough to fit you and instantly teleport to any tree of the same species within 5 miles that also has a sufficiently large trunk. Once you enter the first tree, you instantly know the rough locations of other sufficiently large trees of the same species within range and can leave from the original tree, if you prefer. You canâ€™t carry extradimensional spaces with you; if you attempt to do so, the spell fails.

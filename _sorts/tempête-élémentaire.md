You emit light like a torch. If hit by an attack from an adjacent foe, you can use a reaction to deal 1d8 damage per level of the triggering spell. The damage type is the same as that of the triggering spell, and the spell gains that trait (choose one if the triggering spell deals multiple eligible types). This dismisses the spell.

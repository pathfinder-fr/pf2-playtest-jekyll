summary: '..'
---
You shout a command that's hard to ignore. You can command the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the fleeing condition), drop what it's holding, drop prone, or stand in place. The effects depend on the target's Will save.

**Réussite** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target spends its first action doing as you commanded, and the spell is dismissed.

**Échec critique** The target does as you commanded, spending as many actions as possible doing so, and does nothing else.

summary: '..'
---
You attempt to call forth the dead creature’s soul, requiring the creature’s body be present and relatively intact. The creature must have died within the past 3 days. If Pharasma has decided that the creature’s time has come (GM’s discretion), or if the creature doesn’t wish to return to life, this spell automatically fails, but the diamonds aren’t consumed in the casting. If the spell is successful, the creature is no longer dead and returns to life with 1 Hit Point, no spells prepared, no points in any pools, and it is still suffering from any longterm debilitations of the old body. The time spent in the Boneyard leaves the character temporarily debilitated, making it enervated 2 for 1 week; this condition can’t be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. The creature is also permanently changed in some way by their time in the afterlife, such as a slight personality shift, a streak of white in the hair, or a strange new birthmark.

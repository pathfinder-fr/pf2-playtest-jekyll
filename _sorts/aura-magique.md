You can choose to have the target register as a common magic item of your level in your spellcasting class or lower, or to have it register as being under the effects of a spell of your choice that you can cast. If the target is magical, you can instead choose to have it not register as magical at all. A caster using detect magic or study aura of an equal or higher spell level can attempt to disbelieve the illusion of a magic aura. Magic aura doesnâ€™t mask auras of spells that are 9th level or higher or of items that are 19th level or higher.

You can target a creature instead of an object. When you do, you can either conceal the auras of all magic items it has or have that creature register as being under the effect of a spell you know.

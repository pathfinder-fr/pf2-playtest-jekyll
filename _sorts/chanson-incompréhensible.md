Fleeting notes of a strange and unnatural song fill the air, overtaking the mind. Each target must attempt a Will save when you cast the spell, and again each time you Concentrate on the Spell. A creature needs to attempt only save against the song each round, and you have to keep the same targets when you Concentrate on the Spell.

You afflict the target with a curse that makes its presence off-putting and grating, depending on the outcome of its Will save.

**Réussite** Per failure, but the effect ends on its own after 1 minute instead.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check, and all creatures she encounters have an initial attitude toward her of one step worse (for instance, unfriendly instead of indifferent). The effect is permanent.

**Échec critique** Per failure, but all creatures the target encounters have an initial attitude towards her of two steps worse.

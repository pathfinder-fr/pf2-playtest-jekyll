---
You converse with an ally to stoke her zeal for battle, or sing songs of righteous anger to set up a sympathetic bond. The next time you and that ally roll initiative, you both use the higher of your two initiative rolls. If you roll initiative, if you use this boon again, or if either of you rests, the spell ends.

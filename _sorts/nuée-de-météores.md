You call down four blazing meteors that explode. Each meteor deals 3d10 bludgeoning damage to any creatures in the 10-foot burst at the center of each area of effect; the meteor then explodes, dealing 14d6 fire damage to any creatures in each émanation de 8 cases. The meteors’ central 10-foot bursts can’t overlap, and a creature takes the same amount of fire damage no matter how many overlapping explosions it’s caught in. Each creature in the area can attempt a Reflex saving throw, which applies to both types of damage.

**Réussite** Half damage.

**Réussite critique** No damage.

**Échec** Full damage.

**Échec critique** Double damage.

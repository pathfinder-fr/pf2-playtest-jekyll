You conjure an extradimensional demiplane consisting of a spacious dwelling with a single entrance. The entrance connects back to the plane where you cast the spell, appearing where you choose within the spell’s range. It appears as a faint, shimmering, vertical rectangle 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. You designate who can enter when you cast the spell. Once you enter the portal, you can shut the entrance, making it invisible. You and creatures you designated can reopen the door at will with the Interact action, just like opening a physical door. Other creatures must use extraplanar travel, such as plane shift, in order to enter the mansion. Inside, the demiplane appears to be a mansion with a magnificent foyer and numerous opulent chambers. The mansion can have any floor plan you imagine as you cast the spell, provided it fits within a space 40 feet wide, 40 feet deep, and 30 feet tall. While the entrance is closed, effects from outside the mansion fail to penetrate it, and vice versa. You can use scrying magic and similar effects to observe the outside only if they’re capable of crossing planes. A staff of up to 24 servants attends to anyone within the mansion. These are like the servant created by the unseen servant spell, though they’re visible, with an appearance you determine during casting. The mansion is stocked with enough food to serve a nine-course banquet to 150 people.

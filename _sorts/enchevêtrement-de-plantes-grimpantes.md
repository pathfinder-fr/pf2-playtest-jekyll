Dense, twitching creepers sprout from every surface and fill any bodies of water in the area. Any creature moving on the land, climbing, or swimming within the creepers is entangled until it leaves the area. Once per round, you can Concentrate on the Spell to have a vine lash out from any square within the expanse of creepers. This vine has a 15-foot reach and makes a melee touch attack using your bonus. If the attack succeeds, the vine pulls the target into the creepers and makes it immobile for 1 round or until the creature Escapes (using your spell DC as the Escape DC), whichever comes first.

You turn yourself invisible and create an illusory duplicate of yourself. When you Concentrate on the Spell, you can mentally dictate a course of action for your duplicate to follow that round. Your duplicate acts as though it had your full number of actions, though it can’t actually affect anything in the environment. Both the invisibility and the duplicate remain as long as you concentrate. Per a 4th-level invisibility spell, committing a hostile action doesn’t end mislead’s invisibility. A creature that determines the duplicate is an illusion doesn’t necessarily know you’re invisible, and one that can see your invisible form doesn’t necessarily know your duplicate is an illusion. If you Cast a Spell, attack, or otherwise interact with another creature, you can attempt a Deception check as part of that action against observers’ Perception DCs to convince them your duplicate took that action. This doesn’t fool anyone who’s aware your duplicate is an illusion, nor does it work if the attack obviously couldn’t have come from the duplicate. For instance, if you fired a ray you could make it look like it came from the duplicate, if the duplicate is positioned appropriately, but if you attack with a staff and your duplicate is across the room from the target, your attempt at deception would fail.

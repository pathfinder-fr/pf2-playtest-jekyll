summary: '..'
---
You concentrate ethereal energy and attack a creature’s spirit, dealing 12d6 force damage. It must attempt a Fortitude save. Because spirit blast affects the creature’s spirit, it can damage a target projecting its consciousness or possessing another creature even if the target’s body is elsewhere. The possessed creature isn’t harmed by the blast. The blast doesn’t harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs.

**Réussite** Half damage.

**Réussite critique** No damage.

**Échec** Full damage.

**Échec critique** Double damage.

You mime creating an invisible 10-foot-by-10-foot stretch of wall adjacent to you and within your reach. The wall is solid to those creatures who don’t disbelieve it, and you and your allies can choose to believe the wall exists in order to keep it solid, for instance in order to climb onto it. Even incorporeal creatures who fail to disbelieve the wall can’t pass through it. A creature who disbelieves is bolstered against your house of imaginary walls. The wall doesn’t block objects or creatures who didn’t see your visual performance. The wall has AC 10, TAC 6, and Hardness equal to twice the spell’s level.

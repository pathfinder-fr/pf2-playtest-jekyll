---
A massive storm cloud forms in the air in a 360-foot burst. Beneath it, rain begins to fall, and whipping winds impose a –4 circumstance penalty to physical ranged attacks and weapon ranged attacks. When you cast this spell and the first time each round you Concentrate on the Spell, you can choose one of the following storm effects. You can’t choose the same one twice in a row.

Acid Rain

Each creature in the storm takes 3d8 acid damage with no saving throw.

Hail

The storm deals 3d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures beneath it. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage to half (no damage on a critical success).

Lightning

Up to 10 bolts of lightning strike down, targeting creatures of your choice in the storm. No more than one bolt can target any one creature. Each bolt deals 5d6 electricity damage ( half damage on a successful Reflex save, no damage on a critical success, and double damage on a critical failure).

Rain and Wind

Heavy rain and whipping wind reduce visibility and mobility, making the area under the storm cloud concealed and difficult terrain.

Thunderclap

Each creature in the storm must succeed at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 10 minutes. A creature that succeeds is bolstered against thunderclaps from the same storm of vengeance spell.

Heightened

10th

The range increases to 2,200 feet and the cloud is a 1,000-foot burst.

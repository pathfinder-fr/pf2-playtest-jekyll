The target consistently believes one thing is another, can’t detect something that’s there, or detects something that’s not there. You choose which of these options applies and determine the specifics of the hallucination. For example, you could make the target think all elves are humans, be unable to detect the presence of his brother, think his beloved pocket watch is always on his person even when it isn’t, or believe there’s a tower in the center of town. The target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the hallucination every time he Seeks or Interacts with the subject of the hallucination. For example, the target could attempt to disbelieve each time he encountered an elf, bumped into his brother accidentally, tried to check his pocket watch, or studied the tower to spot vulnerabilities. The target can attempt to disbelieve with a large circumstance bonus in circumstances determined by the GM, such as if the target attempted to climb the nonexistent tower.

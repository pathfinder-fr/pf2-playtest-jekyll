You alter the target’s memories, either erasing a memory, enhancing a memory’s clarity, altering a memory, or adding a false memory. The target can attempt a Will save to resist the spell.

**Réussite** The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of modify memory, unless it identifies the spell (usually by spending the Identify Magic action).

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected and realizes you tried to alter its memory.

**Échec** During the first 5 minutes of the spell’s duration, you can Concentrate on the Spell to modify a memory once each round. When you do, you imagine up to 6 seconds of memory to modify, to a maximum of 5 continuous minutes of memory. Any memories you’ve altered remain changed as long as the spell is active. If the target moves out of range before the 5 minutes is up, you can’t alter any further memories.

You can cast the spell on a willing target in order to suppress all memory of a particular topic, detailed in 50 words or fewer. The spell patches these omissions with indistinct haze. Instead of having a duration, the effects last indefinitely even in the absence of magic and can be removed only by powerful spells such as alter reality.

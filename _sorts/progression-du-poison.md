You advance one of the target’s toxins to progress to the point that the target needs to attempt its next saving throw. If the target is affected by more than one toxin, you can choose from among the toxins you are aware of; otherwise choose randomly. Against an unwilling creature, you must hit it with a melee touch Strike. On a willing or unconscious creature or on a critical hit against an unwilling creature, you can grant the creature either a +2 conditional bonus or a –2 conditional penalty to its saving throw against the toxin.

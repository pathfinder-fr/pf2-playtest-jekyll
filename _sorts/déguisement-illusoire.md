---
Your illusion can make you appear as another creature of the same body shape and roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds). The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn’t change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can also make clothing and items you wear appear different, such as making your armor look like an ordinary dress. Held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance until you don it again. Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature, and it gives you a +4 conditional bonus to your Deception checks to avoid others seeing through your disguise. You can dismiss this disguise with a Verbal Casting action.

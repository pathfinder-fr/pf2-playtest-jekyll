When you cast maze, you transport the target into an extradimensional maze of eldritch origin. Once each turn, the target can spend 1 action to attempt a Survival check against your spell DC to escape the maze. The possible outcomes of the Survival check are as follows.

**Réussite** The creature is on the right path to the exit. If the target was already on the right path, it escapes the maze and the spell ends.

**Réussite critique** The creature escapes and the spell ends.

**Échec** The creature makes no progress toward escape.

**Échec critique** The creature makes no progress toward escape, and if it was on the right path it no longer is. Teleportation magic doesn’t help the creature escape unless the magic can transport across planes, such as plane shift. When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns in the space it occupied when it was banished, or the nearest space if the original space is now filled. It loses any remaining actions it would have on its current turn, but it can spend reactions normally.

You take on the stance of the flowing winds, sending out waves of energy to attack at a distance. You can make wind crash unarmed Strikes as ranged Strikes against targets within 30 feet. These deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage, use the brawling group, and have the agile, nonlethal, propulsive, and unarmed traits. Wind crash Strikes ignore screening. While in wild winds stance, you gain a +1 conditional bonus to AC against ranged attacks.

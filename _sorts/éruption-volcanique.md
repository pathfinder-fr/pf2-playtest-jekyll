The ground opens up, spraying a column of lava high into the air in a vertical cylinder, dealing 13d6 fire damage. Creatures in the area must attempt a Reflex save or take 13d6 fire damage. The lava rapidly cools, and creatures in the area might become partially encased in rock depending on their Reflex saves. A creature encased in rock is sluggish 1, is hampered 5 feet, and when flying treats all normal terrain as difficult terrain. A flying creature immediately descends 20 feet the moment it’s encased, but doesn’t take falling damage from this movement. A creature encased in rock can attempt to Break Open or Escape against your spell DC to end the effect. Otherwise, the creature remains encased until it takes a total of 50 damage, freeing it from the rock. Additionally, creatures in the area that critically succeed at their saves and creature that are within 5 feet of the lava column automatically takes 2d6 fire damage from the intense heat.

**Réussite** Half damage and not encased.

**Réussite critique** No damage and not encased.

**Échec** Full damage and encased.

**Échec critique** Double damage and encased.

You change the target’s text to different text entirely. If the text is a spellbook or a scroll, you can change it to show a spell you know of secret page’s level or lower, though the replacement spell cannot be cast or used to prepare a spell. You can also transform the text into some other text you have written or have access to. You can specify a password that allows any creature touching the book to change the text back and forth. You must choose the replacement text and the password, if any, when you cast the spell.

summary: '..'
---
Your hands become infused with positive energy as you lay them on the target, healing a living target or damaging an undead target. If you use lay on hands on a willing living target, you restore Hit Points equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and if the target is an ally, he gains a +1 conditional bonus to AC for 1 round. Against an undead target, you deal the same amount of positive damage if you succeed at a melee touch attack, and the target takes a –1 conditional penalty to AC for 1 round.

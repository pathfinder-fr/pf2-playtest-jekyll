You call forth a beam of glowing moonlight. Make a ranged touch attack against the target. On a hit, you deal 1d6 fire damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier and dazzle the target for 1 round. Double the damage on a critical hit. Damage from moonbeam counts as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.

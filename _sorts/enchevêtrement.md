Plants in the area entangle creatures. Each round a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it is entangled until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also immobile for 1 round. Creatures can attempt Acrobatics or Athletics checks at entangle’s DC to remove these effects.

You transform into a Tiny nonthreatening animal, such as a cat, rat, insect, or lizard. You count as an animal in addition to your normal traits while in this form. You can choose the specific type of animal you turn into (such as a rat or praying mantis). This has no effect on your battle form’s size or statistics. Your gear is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the following abilities:

- AC 13 (TAC 13) and ignore your armor’s check penalty and Speed reduction.

- One or more natural melee attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You’re trained with them. When attacking with them, your attack modifier is +6 and your attacks deal 1 piercing damage (or another type depending on your form, as the GM sees fit). These are Dexterity-based attacks (for the purposes of the sluggish condition, for example).

- Weakness 5 to all physical damage. (If you take physical damage while in this form, you take 5 additional damage.)

- Speed 10 feet.

- Low-light vision, scent.

- Acrobatics +10 and Stealth +10 (unless your own total modifiers are higher); Athletics –4. The special statistics of your pest form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your pest form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, or spending most actions with the manipulate trait that require your hands (the GM determines which manipulate actions you can spend if there’s doubt). You can dismiss this spell by using an action (this action has the concentrate trait).

---
A feral aspect overcomes the targets, making them tough and savage. Targets gain 5 temporary Hit Points, are accelerated 10, and gain weakness 5 to silver. They also grow vicious fangs and claws, both of which are unarmed attacks. The fangs deal 3d8 piercing damage; the claws deal 3d6 slashing damage and have the agile and finesse traits. The targets use their highest weapon or unarmed attack proficiency with these attacks. On a critical hit with one of these weapons, the target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. The targets can’t spend concentrate actions unless those actions have the rage trait. Their Seek actions gain the rage trait during the spell’s duration. A creature can attempt to end the spell’s effect on themself by spending an action and attempting a Will save against your spell DC. If a target is in the light of a full moon, they also grow by one size if they were Medium or smaller. This increases the reach of a Medium or Tiny creature by 5 feet.

You either remove the grabbed condition from the target or suppress one of the following conditions of your choice that’s affecting the target for 1 round: confused, entangled, frightened, or paralyzed. You can Concentrate on the Spell each round to continue to suppress the condition for 1 round, to a maximum of 1 minute. If you don’t remove the effect that provided the condition, the condition returns after you stop Concentrating on the Spell.

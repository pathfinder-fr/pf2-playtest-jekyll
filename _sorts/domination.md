summary: '..'
---
You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn’t act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.

**Réussite** Slowed 1 for 1 round as it fights off your commands.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target follows your orders but attempts a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On success, the spell is dismissed.

**Échec critique** As failure, but the target receives a new save only whenever you give it a new order, and even then only if the new order is against its nature, such as killing its allies.

You form a direct connection with the natural world and request intercession. Nature always refuses unnatural requests and might choose to grant a different request (potentially more powerful or better fitting its nature) than the one you asked for. A primal phenomenon spell can do any of the following things.

- Duplicate any primal spell of 9th level or lower.

- Duplicate any non-primal spell of 7th level or lower.

- Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. At the GM’s discretion, you can try to use primal phenomenon to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous or the spell may have only a partial effect.

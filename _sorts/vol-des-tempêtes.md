Powerful winds carry you through the air, giving you a fly Speed of 30 feet. When this spell’s duration would end, if you have Spell Points, you can spend 1 Spell Point to increase the duration by 1 minute. Otherwise, if you’re still flying, you float to the ground, per feather fall.

Your fly Speed from stormwind flight doesn’t count flying against the wind as difficult terrain.

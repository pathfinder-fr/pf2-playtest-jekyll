The target or targets move to another dimensional plane, such as the Plane of Fire, the Shadow Plane, Hell, or the Abyss. Attempting to reach a particular plane requires specific knowledge of the plane and a magic tuning fork created from material from that plane; while the tuning forks for most prominent planes are uncommon, just like the spell plane shift, more obscure planes and demiplanes often have rare tuning forks. The spell is highly imprecise, and you appear 1d20×25 miles from the last place one of the targets (of your choice) was located the last time that target traveled to the plane. If it’s the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane, though you can use other means of transit, such as teleport, to travel while on the new plane. Plane shift doesn’t provide a means of return travel, though casting plane shift again allows you to return to your previous plane unless there are extenuating circumstances.

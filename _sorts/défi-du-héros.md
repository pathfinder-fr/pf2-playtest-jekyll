You shout in defiance of your fate. Just before applying the attack’s damage, you recover Hit Points equal to 19d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don’t become unconscious or dying. Either way, you can’t use hero’s defiance again for 1 minute.

The target’s essence and your own become linked. The target takes half damage from all sources that deal Hit Point damage, and you take the remainder of the damage. When you take damage through this link, don’t apply any resistances, weaknesses, and the like that you have to that damage; you simple take that amount of damage. The spell is dismissed if the target is ever more than 30 feet away from you.

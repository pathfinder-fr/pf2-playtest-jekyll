A violent wind issues forth from your outstretched palm, blowing from the point where you are when you cast the spell to the line’s opposite end. The wind extinguishes small nonmagical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows around objects of light Bulk or less, and pushes larger objects. Large or smaller creatures in the area must attempt a Fortitude save. Large or smaller creatures that move into the gust later must attempt the save on entering.

**Réussite** The creature can’t move against the wind.

**Réussite critique** Unaffected.

**Échec** Knocked prone. If it was flying, it suffers the effects of critical failure instead.

**Échec critique** Pushed 30 feet in the wind direction, knocked prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

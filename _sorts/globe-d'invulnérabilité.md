You create an immobile globe around you that attempts to dispel any spell from outside the globe whose area or targets enter into the globe, as if the globe were a dispel magic spell 1 level lower than its actual spell level. Even if the dispel attempt succeeds, it prevents only the portion of the spell that would have entered the globe (so if the spell also had targets outside the globe or part of its area were beyond the globe, those targets or area would still be affected normally). You must form the sphere in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects or the spell is lost (though creatures can enter the area afterward normally).

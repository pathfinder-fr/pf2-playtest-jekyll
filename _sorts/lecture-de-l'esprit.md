You read the target’s mind, depending on its Will save. Once you cast mind reading on a target, you can’t target that creature again until the duration ends.

**Réussite** You find out whether the target’s Intelligence is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.

**Réussite critique** The target perceives vague surface thoughts from you when you cast the spell.

**Échec** You perceive vague surface thoughts from the target when you cast the spell, and you find out whether its Intelligence is higher than, equal to, or lower than yours.

**Échec critique** Per failure, and for the duration of the spell, you can Concentrate on the Spell to detect the target’s surface thoughts again. The target doesn’t get any additional saves.

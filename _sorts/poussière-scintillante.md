Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust, with an effect depending on their Reflex save results. If a creature has its invisibility negated by this spell, it is concealed instead of invisible. This applies both if the creature was already invisible and if it benefits from new invisibility effects before the invisibility negation effect runs out.

**Réussite** The target’s invisibility is negated for 1 round.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target is dazzled for 1 minute and its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.

**Échec critique** The target is blinded for 1 round and dazzled for 1 minute. Its invisibility is negated for 1 minute.

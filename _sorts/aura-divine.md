Divine power wards the targets, granting a +1 conditional bonus to AC and saves while in the area. Choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. If you choose chaos, this spell gains the lawful trait and so on. The bonuses increase to +2 against attacks by creatures of the chosen alignment and effects created by such creatures. The bonuses increase to +4 against effects from such creatures that directly control the target and attacks made by summoned creatures of the chosen alignment. When a creature of the chosen alignment hits a target with a melee attack, it must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 minute. Itâ€™s bolstered against all divine auras for the duration. The first time you Concentrate on the Spell each round, the radius grows 10 feet.

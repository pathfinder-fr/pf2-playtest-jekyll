The target experiences a day’s worth of recovery in an instant. Any detrimental effects that would be gone after 24 hours end, though this doesn’t shorten the duration of any active spells affecting the target. The target regains Hit Points and recovers from conditions as if it had taken 24 hours of rest. The creature doesn’t regain spells for resting or get other benefits of rest other than healing. The target is then bolstered against all moment of renewal spells.

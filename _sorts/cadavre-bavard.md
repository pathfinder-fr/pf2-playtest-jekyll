summary: '..'
---
You grant the corpse a semblance of life, which it uses to speak the answers to three questions. This uses the physical body’s latent memories rather than calling back the deceased’s spirit, so the corpse must be mostly intact. The more damage it has taken, the more inaccurate or patchwork its answers, and it must have a throat and mouth to speak at all. If anyone has previously cast this spell on the corpse in the last week, the spell automatically fails. The corpse can attempt a Will save to resist the questions as if it were the original creature at its time of death, with the following effects.

**Réussite** The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions.

**Réussite critique** The target can lie or refuse to answer your questions, and the target’s spirit haunts you throughout the day, bothering you and causing you to be unable to gain any rest for 1 day.

**Échec** The target must answer truthfully, but its answers can be brief, cryptic, and repetitive. It can still mislead you or attempt to stall so that the spell’s duration runs out before you can ask all your questions.

**Échec critique** Per failure, but the target’s answers are more direct and less repetitive, though still cryptic. It takes a –2 conditional penalty to Deception checks to deceive you.

---
You create a sticky web in the area that impedes creatures’ movement each time they try to move through it. Squares filled with the web are difficult terrain. Each square can be cleared of the web by a single attack or effect that deals at least 5 slashing damage or 1 fire damage. A square has AC 5 and TAC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. Each time a creature begins to use a move action while in the web, it must attempt an Athletics check against your spell DC to avoid being entangled or immobilized. A creature that gets out of the web ceases to be entangled by it.

**Réussite** The creature is unaffected and clears the web from every square it leaves after leaving the square.

**Réussite critique** The creature is unaffected and doesn’t need to attempt further saving throws against the web this turn. It clears the web from every square it leaves after leaving the square.

**Échec** The creature is entangled until the start of its next turn but doesn’t need to attempt further saving throws against the web during this action.

**Échec critique** The creature is immobilized until the start of its next turn, after which it is entangled for 1 round.

You speak or sing without interruption throughout the casting and duration. Targets that notice your speech or song might give their undivided attention, depending on their Will saves. The GM may grant a circumstance bonus (to a maximum of +4) if the target is of an opposing religion, ancestry, or political leaning, or is otherwise unlikely to agree with what you’re saying. Each creature that enters range has to attempt a save when you Concentrate on the Spell. If you’re speaking, enthrall is lingual.

**Réussite** The target needn’t pay attention but doesn’t notice you tried to use magic (it might notice others are enthralled).

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target is fascinated with you. It can attempt a Will save if it witnesses actions or speech with which it disagrees. If it succeeds, it’s no longer fascinated and bolstered to this casting of enthrall. The fascination ends instantly if the creature is subject to a hostile act or a successful Diplomacy or Intimidation check against the spell’s DC.

**Échec critique** As failure, but the target can’t attempt a save to end the fascination if it disagrees with you.

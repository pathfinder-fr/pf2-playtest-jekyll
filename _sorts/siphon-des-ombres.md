You transform the triggering spell into a partially illusory version of itself. Treat this as a dispel attempt, except that if the dispel attempt is successful, any creatures that would be damaged by the spell instead take only half as much damage. Treat shadow siphonâ€™s counteract level as 2 higher for this dispel attempt.

You quiet the target’s voice, preventing it from giving away valuable secrets. This doesn’t prevent the target from talking or performing Verbal Casting actions, but no creature more than 10 feet away can hear its croaking whispers without a successful Perception check against forced quiet’sDC, which might interfere with auditory or lingual effects as well as communication. The duration depends on the target’s Fortitude save, and the target is bolstered against your forced quiet.

**Réussite** The effect’s duration is 1 round

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The effect’s duration is 1 minute

**Échec critique** The effect’s duration is 10 minutes.

You create a temporary standard-quality object. It must be of vegetable matter and 1 Bulk or less. It can’t rely on intricate craftsmanship or complex moving parts, never functions as a cost or the like, and can’t be made of special materials or materials with a rarity of uncommon or higher. It is obviously temporary conjured, and its aesthetic matches your style of craftsmanship or artistry.

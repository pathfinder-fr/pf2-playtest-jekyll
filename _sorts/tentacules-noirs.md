Tentacles rise and attempt to Grapple each creature in the area. Make spell rolls against the Fortitude DC of each creature. Any creature you succeed against is grabbed and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Whenever a creature ends its turn in the tentacles, the tentacles attempt to grab that creature if they haven't already, and deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to any creature grabbed. The tentacles' escape DC is equal to your spell DC. A creature can attack a tentacle in an attempt to release its grip. It has AC 25 and TAC 23 and is destroyed if it takes 12 damage or more.

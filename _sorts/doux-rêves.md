You protect the target’s dreams from malevolent influences and fill them with positive and restful images. The target gains a +4 conditional bonus to saves against magic that attacks their dreams, such as nightmare. As long as they aren’t actively using their dreams, such as with dream council or dreaming potential, they also recover 1 additional Hit Point per level for their 8-hour rest.

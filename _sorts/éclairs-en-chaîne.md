summary: '..'
---
You discharge a powerful bolt of lightning at the target, dealing 7d12 electricity damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save. The electricity arcs to another creature within 30 feet of the first target, jumps to another creature within 30 feet of that target, and so on. You can end the chain at any point. You can't target the same creature more than once, and you must have line of effect to all targets. Targets after the first take 6d12 electricity damage and must attempt a Reflex save. Roll the damage only once and apply it to each target (halving or doubling when necessary).

**Réussite** The targets take half damage.

**Réussite critique** The targets are unaffected, and the chain ends.

**Échec** The targets take full damage

**Échec critique** The targets take double damage.

The damage to all targets increases by 1d12.

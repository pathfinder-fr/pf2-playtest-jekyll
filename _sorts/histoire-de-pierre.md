You can ask questions of and receive answers from natural or worked stone. While stone is not intelligent, you speak with the natural spirits of the stone, which have a personality colored by the type of stone, as well as by the type of structure the stone is part of, for worked stone. A stone’s perspective, perception, and knowledge give it a worldview different enough from a human’s that it doesn’t consider the same details important. Stones can mostly answer questions about those that touched them in the past and what is concealed beneath them.

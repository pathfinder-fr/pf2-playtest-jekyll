You supercharge the target's confidence, causing it to rationalize failures as sour grapes. It takes a –2 conditional penalty to skill checks to retry a task it attempted and failed during the duration. On its turn, it takes a –1 conditional penalty to attack rolls if it failed its first attack, or –2 if it failed both of its first two attacks. The duration depends on its Will save, and it's bolstered.

**Réussite** The effect lasts for 1 round.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The effect lasts for 10 minutes.

**Échec critique** The effect lasts for 24 hours.

Pain wracks the target, dealing 1d4 mental damage and 1d4 persistent mental damage. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.

**Réussite** Full damage, but no persistent damage and the spell ends immediately.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** Full damage, and the target is sick 1. If the target recovers from being sick, its persistent mental damage ends as well and the spell ends.

**Échec critique** Per failure, but the target is sick 2.

Heightened

1

The damage increases by 2d4 and the persistent damage by 1.

You transform into a Medium animal battle form. You count as an animal in addition to your normal traits while in this form. Your gear is absorbed into your form; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate any item abilities. When you transform, you gain the following:

- Low-light vision.

- Treat your Athletics bonus as +12, unless your own bonus is already higher.

- AC 23 (TAC 20), ignore armor’s check penalty and reduced Speed.

- 10 temporary Hit Points that go away when you leave your battle form.

- Each form grants one or more natural melee attacks, as detailed in the insect types below, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You’re trained with them. When attacking with them, your attack modifier is +10 and your damage bonus is +2. These are Strength-based attacks (for the purposes of the enfeebled condition, for example). The special statistics of your battle form can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, or using most actions with the manipulate trait that require hands (the GM determines which actions of this sort you can take if there’s doubt).You can dismiss this spell with a Concentrate on the Spell action. If you prepare this spell, choose from the following options. When in battle form, you gain the attacks, movement types, and special abilities listed. You can choose a more specific type of animal to turn into (such as a ladybug or scarab for beetle). This has no effect on your battle form’s size or statistics.

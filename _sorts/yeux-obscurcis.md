You infuse a creature's vision with darkness depending on its Fortitude save. The target is bolstered.

**Réussite** It loses darkvision and gains low-light vision for 1 round. If it didn't have darkvision, it loses low-light vision instead.

**Réussite critique** The creature is unaffected.

**Échec** As success, but the effect last for 1 minute.

**Échec critique** As failure, but the target loses darkvision and low-light vision, and if it had neither, it's blinded for 1 minute.

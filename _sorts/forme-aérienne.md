You transform into a Medium flying animal battle form. You count as an animal in addition to your normal traits. Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate it. When you transform, you gain the following:

- AC 26 (TAC 25), ignore armor's check penalty and reduced Speed.

- One or more unarmed melee attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +13 and your damage bonus is +5. These are Dexterity based (for the purpose of sluggish, for example).

- 5 temporary Hit Points while you have the form.

- Low-light vision.

- Acrobatics bonus of +14 unless your own bonus is higher. These special statistics can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents casting spells, speaking, or taking most manipulate actions that require hands. (The GM decides if there's doubt.) You can dismiss the spell with a concentrate action. When you prepare this spell, choose from the options below. You gain the attacks, Speeds, and special abilities listed. You can choose the specific type of animal (such as an owl or eagle for bird). This has no effect on the Size or statistics

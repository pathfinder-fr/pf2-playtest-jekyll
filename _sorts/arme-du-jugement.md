An immense weapon of force appears, hovering in the air above the target. The weapon has the ghostly visual appearance of your deity’s favored weapon. Name war or peace when you cast this spell. If you name war, the weapon Strikes the target at the end of each of its turns that the target failed to act in a hostile manner against a particular creature. You mentally choose one creature when you name war, and the target instinctively knows which creature it is. This must be a creature both you and the target can see. If you name peace, the weapon Strikes the target each time the target acts in a hostile manner against you or one of your allies. You mentally choose up to five allies when you name peace, and the target instinctively knows who those allies are. The weapon Strikes only once per act, even if the act targets multiple allies. Attacks with the weapon use your attack modifier with that type of weapon, but they substitute your spellcasting ability modifier instead of the normal ability score. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 3d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon takes a multiple attack penalty, but has its own rather than using yours. When you Strike with the weapon, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No other attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A weapon of judgment counts as a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can’t make any kind of attack other than a normal Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.

---
Choose one piece of information that at least some of the targets know; affected allies must remain within range for the full minute during which you cast the spell. This grants those who know the piece of knowledge you have chosen a +4 conditional bonus to skill checks (typically Deception checks) to conceal this knowledge and to saving throws against spells that specifically attempt to obtain this knowledge from them or against effects that would force them to reveal it. These bonuses last until you use this power again.

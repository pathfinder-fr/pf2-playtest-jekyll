You discover the target’s exact location by name (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence. You can target a creature only if you’ve seen it in person or have a significant belonging or a piece of its body. To target an object, you must have touched it or have a fragment. Discern location overcomes lower-level protections against detection and divination.

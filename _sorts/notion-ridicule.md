You speak a phrase so absurd that it can cause creatures to laugh. Each target must attempt a Will saving throw. A target is bolstered against your ridiculous notion once it succeeds at its save or once the duration ends if it fails the save.

**Réussite** Unaffected.

**Échec** The target breaks into a paroxysm of laughter. It’s slowed 1 and can’t make reactions.

**Échec critique** The target laughs so hard it falls prone and can’t use any actions, reactions, or free actions.

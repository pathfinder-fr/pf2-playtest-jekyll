You transform into a Medium animal battle form. You count as an animal in addition to your normal traits. Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate it. When you transform, you gain the following:

- AC 22 (TAC 20), ignore armor's check penalty and reduced Speed.

- One or more unarmed melee attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +10 and your damage bonus is +5. These are Strength based (for the purpose of enfeebled, for example).

- 10 temporary Hit Points while you have the form.

- Low-light vision.

- Athletics bonus of +11 unless your own is higher. These special statistics can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents casting spells, speaking, or using most actions with the manipulate trait that require hands. (The GM decides if there's doubt.) You can dismiss the spell with a concentrate action. If you prepare this spell, choose from the options below. You gain the attacks, Speeds, and special abilities listed. You can choose the specific type of animal (such as lion or snow leopard for cat). This has no effect on size or statistics.

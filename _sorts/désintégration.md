You fire a green ray at your target. Make a ranged touch attack. You deal 12d10 damage and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. On a critical hit, treat the save result as one degree worse. A creature reduced to 0 HP is reduced to fine powder; gear remains. An object you hit is destroyed (no save), regardless of Hardness, unless it’s an artifact or similarly hard to destroy. A single casting can destroy no more than a 10-foot cube of matter. This automatically destroys any force construct, such as a wall of force.

**Réussite** The target takes half damage.

**Échec** The target takes full damage.

**Échec critique** The target takes double damage

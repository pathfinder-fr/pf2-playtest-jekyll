You call forth a wave to move the target either in a body of water or on the ground. The result depends on the target’s Fortitude save.

**Échec** You move the target 5 feet in any direction along the ground or through the body of water.

**Échec critique** You move the target up to 10 feet in any direction along the ground or through the body of water.

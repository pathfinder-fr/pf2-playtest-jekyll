You conjure greasy goo, with effects based on your target.

- Target an Area Each creature within the area must attempt an Acrobatics check to Maintain Balance against your spell DC. Creatures later entering a square within the area must also attempt an Acrobatics check to Balance. A creature that takes a Step doesn’t have to Balance.

- Target an Object If you cast the spell on an unattended object, those trying to pick up the object must succeed at an Acrobatics check against your spell DC to do so. If you target an attended object, the creature that has the object must attempt an Acrobatics check. On a failure, the holder or wielder takes a –2 circumstance penalty to any attack roll or to any check attempted that involves using the object; on a critical failure, the holder or wielder drops the item. The object lands in an adjacent square of the GM’s choice. If the object is worn, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saving throws against attempts to grapple or shove them.

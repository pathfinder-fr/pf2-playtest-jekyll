Scrying works like clairvoyance, except that the image you receive is less precise (insufficient for teleport and similar spells) and instead of creating an eye in a set location within 500 feet, you instead create an eye that appears just above the target. You can choose a target either by name or by touching one of its possessions or a fallen piece of its body. If you haven’t met the target in person, scrying’s DC is 2 lower, and if you are unaware of the target’s identity (perhaps because you found an unknown creature’s fang at a crime scene), the DC is instead 10 lower. The effect of scrying depends on the target’s Will save.

**Réussite** The spell fails and the target is bolstered against scrying.

**Réussite critique** The spell fails and the target is bolstered against scrying for 1 week. The target also gains a glimpse of you and learns its rough distance and direction from you.

**Échec** The spell succeeds.

**Échec critique** The spell succeeds, and the eye follows the target if it moves, traveling up to 60 feet per round.

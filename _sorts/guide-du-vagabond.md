You call upon your deity to guide your route, allowing you and allies who travel overland with you to reduce the distance reduction from difficult terrain by half for the duration, as long as you don’t deviate from the divinely inspired route. This doesn’t have any effect on movement during encounters. If you use this ability again before the duration is over, this effect ends and is replaced by that of the new route.

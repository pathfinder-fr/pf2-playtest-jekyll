summary: '..'
---
You and the targets instantly transport to any location within range, as long as you can identify the location precisely both by its position relative to your starting position and by its appearance. Incorrect knowledge of the location’s appearance usually causes the spell to fail, but it could lead to teleporting to an unwanted location or some other unusual mishap determined by the GM. Teleport is not precise over great distances. The targets appear at a distance from the intended destination equal to roughly 1% of the total distance traveled, in a direction determined by the GM. For short journeys, this lack of precision is irrelevant, but journeys of the maximum 100 miles are 1 mile off target.

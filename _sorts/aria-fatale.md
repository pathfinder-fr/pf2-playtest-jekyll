You perform music so perfect that the target dies of joy or sorrow. Once targeted, the target is bolstered against all castings of fatal aria. The effect of the spell depends on the target’s level and current Hit Points. 16th or Lower The target dies instantly. 17th If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, the target drops to 0 Hit Points and gains dying 1 or, if it’s already dying, increases its dying condition by 1. 18th or Higher The target takes 50 damage. If this brings it to 0 Hit Points, it dies instantly.

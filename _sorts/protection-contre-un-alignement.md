Choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful when you cast this spell. If you choose chaos, this spell gains the lawful trait and vice versa. If you choose evil, this spell gains the good trait and vice versa. The target gains a +1 conditional bonus to their Armor Class against attacks by creatures of the chosen alignment and on saving throws against effects created by such creatures. This bonus increases to +3 against effects from such creatures that would directly control the target and against attacks made by summoned creatures of the chosen alignment.

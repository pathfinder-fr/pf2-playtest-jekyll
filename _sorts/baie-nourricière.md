summary: '..'
---
You imbue the target berry with the bounty of nature, allowing it to heal and sustain far beyond its normal capacity. A living creature that eats the berry with an Interact action gains as much nourishment as a square meal for a typical human and regains 1d4 Hit Points plus your spellcasting ability modifier. If not consumed during the duration, the berry withers away.

---
You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about 1 square inch in size, on the touched creature or object. The mark can be visible or invisible, and you can change it from one state to another by spending a Somatic Casting action during which you touch the target. The mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of work. If it’s on a creature, it fades naturally over the course of a week. The time before the mark fades increases depending on your level.

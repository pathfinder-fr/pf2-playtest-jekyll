Choose a spell and name it aloud as part of the Verbal Casting action. Spell immunity attempts to dispel that spell (see page 197) whenever spell immunity’s target is the target of the named spell or in that spell’s area. Successfully dispelling a spell that targets an area or multiple targets with spell immunity negates the effects only for spell immunity’s target.

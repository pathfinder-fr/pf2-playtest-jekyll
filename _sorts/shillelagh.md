The target grows vines and leaves, brimming with primal energy. The target gains the effects of a +1 weapon potency rune in your hands, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and dealing another die of damage on a hit. Additionally, as long as you are on your home plane, attacks you make with the target against aberrations, extraplanar creatures, and undead deal a third die of damage on a hit.

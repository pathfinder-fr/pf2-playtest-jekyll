You call on your muse to greatly increase your inspire courage composition’s benefits. Attempt a Performance check. The DC is usually a high-difficulty DC of a level equal to that of the highest-level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your inspire courage depends on the result of your check.

**Réussite** The spell bonus from inspire courage increases to +2.

**Réussite critique** The spell bonus from your inspire courage increases to +3.

**Échec** Your inspire courage retains its normal bonus of +1.

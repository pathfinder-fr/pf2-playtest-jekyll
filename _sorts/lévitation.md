You levitate the target 5 feet off the ground. For the duration, you can spend a Somatic Casting action to move the target up or down 10 feet. A creature floating in the air from levitate takes a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. A floating creature can spend an Interact action to stabilize itself and negate these penalties for the remainder of its turn. If the target is adjacent to a fixed object or terrain of suitable stability, it can move across the surface by climbing if the surface is vertical (like a wall) or crawling if the surface is horizontal (such as a ceiling). The GM determines which surfaces can be climbed or crawled across.

summary: '..'
---
You call a rain of divine fire that plummets down from above, dealing 8d6 fire damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save. Because the flame is infused with divine energy, creatures in the area apply only half their usual fire resistance. Creatures that are immune to fire treat their result on the saving throw as one degree of success better instead of gaining the usual benefit of immunity.

**Réussite** The creature takes half damage.

**Réussite critique** The creature is unaffected.

**Échec** The creature takes full damage.

**Échec critique** The creature takes double damage.

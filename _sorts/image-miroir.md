Three illusory images swirl about your space, potentially causing those who attack you to hit one of the images instead of you. Any attack that would hit you has a random chance of hitting one of your images instead. If you have all three images up, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on a 1d4). With two images up, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1–2 on a 1d6). With only one image the chances are 1 in 2 (1–3 on a 1d6). If an image is hit, it is destroyed. If the attack roll is a critical success and would hit one of the images, it becomes a success against you and one of the images is also destroyed. Once all the images are destroyed, the spell is dismissed.

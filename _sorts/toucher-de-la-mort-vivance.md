You attack the target’s life force with the taint of undeath via a melee touch attack, dealing 2d8 negative damage. The effect depends on your attack roll.

**Réussite** The target takes full damage, and positive effects heal the target only half as much as normal for 1 round.

**Réussite critique** The target takes double damage, and positive effects can’t heal the target for 1 round and heal the target only half as much as normal for 1 minute.

**Échec** The target is unaffected.

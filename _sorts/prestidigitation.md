You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you Concentrate on the Spell. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. Each time you Concentrate on the Spell, you can choose one of four options, based on your type of magic.

- Cook (arcane, primal) Chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.

- Lift (arcane, divine, occult) Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.

- Make (arcane, divine, occult) Create an object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance and temporary in nature. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile—it crumbles if put under too much strain and can’t be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.

- Tidy (arcane, primal) Color, clean, or soil an object of light or less Bulk. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration or a larger object, such as a suit of armor, with 5 minutes of concentration. Prestidigitation can’t deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, coloring, or soiling it) persists only as long as you Concentrate on the Spell.

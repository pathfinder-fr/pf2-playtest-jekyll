summary: '..'
---
A vine covered in sticky sap appears from thin air, flicking from your hand and lashing itself to the target. Attempt a ranged touch attack against the target.

**Réussite** The target is entangled. It can attempt an Acrobatics or Athletics check against your spell DC to remove the entangled condition (and immobile condition, if necessary).

**Réussite critique** Per success, and the target immobile as long as it’s entangled.

**Échec** No effect.

You hurl a held melee weapon at the target, making a ranged Strike using your proficiency with the weapon or with spells, whichever is worse. Add your spellcasting ability modifier to damage, rather than your Strength modifier. Whether the attack succeeds or fails, the weapon flies back to you and returns to your hand.

You afflict the target with the curse of the roiling sea, depending on its Will save.

**Réussite** The target becomes sick 1. Reducing its sick condition to 0 ends the curse.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target becomes sick 1 and can’t reduce its sick condition below 1 while the curse remains. Whenever it is sick and on the water at least a mile from shore, it is also slowed 1.

**Échec critique** Per failure, but the target becomes sick 2.

You create a cloud of mist in the area that makes creatures within concealed. (The concealment is not a poison effect.) A creature that ends its turn within the cloud must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Réussite** Sick 1.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** Sick 1, and slowed 1 until it leaves the cloud.

**Échec critique** Sick 2, and slowed 1 until it leaves the cloud.

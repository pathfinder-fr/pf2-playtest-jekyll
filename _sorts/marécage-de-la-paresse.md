summary: '..'
---
Ground in the area turns swampy and fetid, like an Abyssal mire. The area is difficult terrain, but not deep enough to require or allow swimming. The sludge at the bottom of the morass animates into Diminutive sludge beasts with a demonic appearance. These don’t function as normal creatures, but they swarm over creatures in the swamp and exude a noxious stench. The swamp deals 1d6 poison damage to any creature that ends its turn there, depending on its Fortitude save.

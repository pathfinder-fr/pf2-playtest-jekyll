You create an opaque wall of shimmering, multicolored light. The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet across and 30 feet high. You must form the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects or the spell is lost. You can pass through the wall and ignore its effects. The wall sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side. Creatures other than you that come into the wall’s light must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature that attempts a save is then bolstered against that particular prismatic wall’s blinding effect. A prismatic wall has seven different colors, each with the effect of a 5th-level chromatic wall spell of that color. A creature that tries to pass through the wall must attempt a saving throw against each component wall. The effects take place simultaneously, so a creature turned to stone by the blue wall is still treated as a creature for the indigo and violet walls. The wall as a whole is immune to dispelling effects of the wall’s level or lower, but each color must be dispelled by its specific spell, as described in chromatic wall. This must be done in order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, then violet). A given color can’t be affected until the previous color is dispelled. Dispelling a color wall removes that color’s effect from the wall, and dispelling them all ends prismatic wall.

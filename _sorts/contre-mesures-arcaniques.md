You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend against. You reduce the spell's level by 1, and targets gain a +1 conditional bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it. You can't reduce the spell's level below its minimum (if any). For example, a 5th-level cone of cold would remain 5th-level, but a 5th-level fireball would become 4th-level.

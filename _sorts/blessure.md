summary: '..'
---
You channel negative energy to harm the living or heal the undead. You restore Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier to a willing undead target, or deal that amount of negative damage to a living target. The number of actions spent Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

- Somatic Casting The spell has a range of touch. You must succeed at a melee touch attack to damage a living target.

- Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting The spell has a range of 30 feet and doesn’t require a touch attack when targeting a living creature. A living target must attempt a Fortitude save, taking half damage on a success, no damage on a critical success, or double damage on a critical failure.

- Material Casting, Somatic Casting, Verbal Casting You disperse negative energy in a 30-foot aura. This has the same effect as the two-action version, but it targets all living and undead creatures in the burst and reduces the amount of healing or damage to your spellcasting ability modifier.

the amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, or by 2d8 if you’re using the 1- or 2-action version to heal undead.

The focus is whisked away until the magic is broken or the spell expires. When you cast alarm, select a password. Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature enters the spell's area without speaking the password, alarm sends your choice of a mental alert that awakens you (in which case the spell gains the mental trait) or an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell (in which case the spell gains the auditory trait). Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to awake if it succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a Stealth check against the spell's DC or trigger the alarm when moving into the area.

When you cast this spell, choose a metamagic feat you have. The next time you trigger that feat, you don’t need to add a Somatic Casting action to the spell you cast. Metamagician’s shortcut ends when this happens. You can’t have more than one metamagician’s shortcut active at a time, and if you cast it again the previous one ends.

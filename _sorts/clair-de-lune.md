You cause the area to shimmer with moonlight. This counts as dim light, but any magical script or arcane symbols in the area glow a slightly brighter blue, granting a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Seek them. Magical ink visible only in moonlight also appears in an area of moonlight glow.

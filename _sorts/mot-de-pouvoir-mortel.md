summary: '..'
---
You utter a word of power that potentially kills the target upon hearing it. Once targeted, the target is bolstered against all castings of power word kill. The effect of the spell depends on the target’s level.

14th or Lower

The target dies instantly.

15th

If the target had 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and gains dying 1 or increases its dying condition by 1 if it’s already dying.

16th or Higher

The target takes 50 damage; if this brings the target to 0 Hit Points, the target dies instantly.

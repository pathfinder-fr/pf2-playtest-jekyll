---
An illusion of horrific otherworldly creatures appears within the spell’s area. The creatures look like Tiny swarming monsters, with a specific appearance of your choice, such as hellish flies or animated saw blades. Any creature that’s inside the burst when it’s created, enters the burst, or ends its turn inside the burst must attempt a Will save to avoid taking 8d8 mental damage. A creature that tries to Interact with the monsters or observes one with a Seek action can attempt to disbelieve the illusion.

**Réussite** Half damage.

**Réussite critique** No damage, and the target can immediately attempt to disbelieve.

**Échec** Full damage.

**Échec critique** Double damage.

The mental damage increases by 1d8.

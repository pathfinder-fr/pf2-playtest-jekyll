You create an opaque wall of light in a vibrant color. The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet across and 30 feet high. If it would pass through a creature, the spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light 20 feet on each side. You can ignore its effects. Roll 1d4 to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. Chromatic wall can't be dispelled normally; rather, each color is automatically dispelled when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell is a lower level than chromatic wall.

1:Red

Destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and deals 15 fire damage to anyone passing through (Reflex half, or none on a critical success). Dispelled by cone of cold.

2:Orange

Destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and deals 20 acid damage to anyone passing through (Reflex half, or none on a critical success). Dispelled by gust of wind.

3:Yellow

Stops acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic effects from passing through, and deals 25 electricity damage to anyone passing through (Reflex half, or none on a critical success). Dispelled by disintegrate.

4:Green

Stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through, and deals 10 poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them enfeebled 1 (Fortitude half damage and negate enfeebled, and no damage on a critical success) for 1 minute. Dispelled by passwall.

Heightened

7th

The spell's duration increases to 1 hour. Roll 1d8 to determine the wall's color. A red, orange, yellow, or green wall deals an extra 10 damage. 5:Blue Stops auditory, petrification, and visual effects from passing through, and those passing through suffer the effects of flesh to stone. Dispelled by magic missile. 6:Indigo Stops divination and mental effects from passing through, and those passing through suffer the effects of warp mind. Dispelled by searing light. 7:Violet Prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal), and creatures passing through are slow 1 for 1 minute (sent to another plane, as the effect of plane shift, on a critical failure). Dispelled by dispel magic. 8:Reroll, and the wall's save DC gets a +2 conditional bonus.

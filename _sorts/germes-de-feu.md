Four acorns grow in your hand, their shells streaked with red patterns. You or anyone else who has one of the acorns can toss it up to 30 feet with an action that has the manipulate trait. It explodes in a 5-foot burst, dealing 4d6 fire damage, and each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save. The save uses your spell DC, even if someone else throws the acorn. Flames continue to burn on the ground in the burst for 1 minute, dealing 2d6 fire damage to any creature that enters the flames or ends its turn within them. A creature can take damage from the continuing flames only once per round, even if it’s in overlapping areas of fire created by different acorns. When the spell ends, any remaining acorns rot and turn to ordinary soil.

**Réussite** The creature takes half damage.

**Réussite critique** The creature is unaffected.

**Échec** The creature takes full damage.

**Échec critique** The creature takes double damage.

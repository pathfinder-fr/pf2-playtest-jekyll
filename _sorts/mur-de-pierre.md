summary: '..'

You create a 1-inch-thick, 120-foot-long, and 20-foot-high wall of stone. You can shape the wall’s path, placing each 5 feet of the wall on the border between squares. The wall doesn’t need to stand vertically, so you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs, for example. You must conjure the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don’t pass through any creatures or objects or the spell is lost. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section of the wall has AC 10, TAC 6, and Hardness 17. A broken section of the wall can be moved through, but rubble created from it is difficult terrain.

The Hardness of each section of the wall increases by 5.

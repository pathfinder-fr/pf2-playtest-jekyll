You draw the target into a lucid dream where it can explore the endless possibilities of its own potential within the everchanging backdrop of its dreamscape. If it sleeps the full 8 hours uninterrupted, when it wakes, it counts as having spent a day of downtime retraining, though it can’t use dreaming potential for any retraining that would require either an instructor or specialized knowledge it can’t access within the dream.

This abjuration reflects spells cast at you back at their caster. When a spell targets you, you can spend a reaction to have spell turning attempt to reflect it. This works like dispelling the spell, but if the spell is successfully dispelled, the effect is turned back on the caster. Whether or not the dispel attempt is successful, spell turning ends. Spell turning can’t affect spells that aren’t targeted (such as area spells). If spell turning reflects a spell back at a caster who also is under the effect of spell turning, his spell turning can attempt to reflect his own spell back at you again; if he does so, his dispel attempt automatically succeeds.

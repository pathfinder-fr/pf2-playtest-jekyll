Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, slowing your target’s reactions depending on its Will save. A particularly slothful creature, such as a dretch, treats the outcome of the saving throw as one degree of success worse. The target is bolstered against your litanies.

**Réussite** The target takes a –1 conditional penalty to all attack rolls attempted as part of reactions (such as Attacks of Opportunity).

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target can’t spend reactions.

**Échec critique** The target can’t spend reactions and is slowed 1.

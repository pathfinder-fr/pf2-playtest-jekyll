summary: '..'
---
You create enough food to feed six Medium creatures for a day; it's bland and unappealing and leaves the eater unsatisfied. After 1 day, if no one has eaten the food, it decays and becomes inedible. Most Small creatures eat one-fourth as much as a Medium creature (one-sixteenth as much for most Tiny creatures), and most Large creatures eat 10 times as much (100 times as much for Huge creatures and so on).

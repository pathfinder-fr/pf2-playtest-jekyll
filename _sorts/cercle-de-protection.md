---
Choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. If you choose chaos, this spell gains the lawful trait and so on. Creatures in the area gain a +1 conditional bonus to AC against attacks by creatures of the chosen alignment and saves against effects from such creatures. This increases to +3 against effects from such creatures that directly control the target and attacks made by such summoned creatures. Summoned creatures of the chosen alignment can't willingly enter without a Will save. Use the first result for repeated attempts.

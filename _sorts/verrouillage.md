summary: '..'
---
The targetâ€™s latch mechanism clinks shut, held fast by unseen magical restraints. You magically lock the target, either setting the Thievery DC equal to your spell DC or using the base lock DC with a +4 conditional bonus, whichever is higher. Any key or combination that once opened a lock affected by this spell does not do so for the duration of the spell. If the lock is opened, the spell is dismissed. Assuming the target is not barred in some other way, you can unlock and open it by spending a Somatic Casting action during which you touch the target. Doing so does not dismiss the spell. You can dismiss the spell at any time and from any distance with a Verbal Casting action.

The duration increases to unlimited, but you must add a Material Casting action and expend 6 gp worth of gold dust as an additional cost.

summary: '..'

A shroud of darkness prevents light from penetrating or emanating within the area. This suppresses magical light of the spell's level or lower. Light can't pass through, so creatures in the area can't see outside. From outside, it appears as a globe of pure darkness.

Even creatures with darkvision (but not greater darkvision) treat targets seen through the darkness as concealed.

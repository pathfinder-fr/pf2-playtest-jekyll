This spell grants perfect sight based on scrying, allowing subjects to track the exact movements or position of one creature or object. Choose one target creature or object in the area to be tracked. It becomes the sensor for the spell. Up to five willing creatures of your choice in the area can see a ghostly image of this creature or object when it’s out of their sight. They can perceive the creature or object perfectly, allowing them to ignore invisibility or the concealed condition, though physical barriers still provide cover. The tracking creatures can see the tracked creature or object through all barriers other than lead or running water, which block their vision. Distance also doesn’t matter, though the creature or object might move so far away it becomes too small to perceive. You don’t scry any of the environment around the creature or object, though you do see any gear a creature is wearing or holding and can tell if it removes objects from its person. If you try to track an unwilling creature, the effect depends on its Will save.

**Réussite** The spell ends after 1 round.

**Réussite critique** The creature or object is unaffected.

**Échec** The other targets track the creature or object.

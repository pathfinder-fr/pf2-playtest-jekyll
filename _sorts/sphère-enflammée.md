You create a sphere of flame in a square within range. The sphere deals 3d6 fire damage to each creature in the sphere’s square; each creature must attempt a Reflex save. Once per round when you Concentrate on this Spell, you can direct the sphere to roll to a spot within range and deal 3d6 fire damage; each creature in that square must attempt a Reflex save. You can’t Concentrate on the Spell to move the sphere during the round you create it.

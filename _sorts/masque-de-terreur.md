summary: '..'
---
The target appears to be a gruesome and terrifying creature to anyone observing it. The effect is unique to each observer, so a human viewing the target might see a demon with bloody fangs and a demon observing the target might see a glowing angelic visage. When any creature attempts a hostile action or reaction against the target, the creature must attempt a Will save. Once it does, it doesn’t need to attempt another save against mask of terror for any actions or reactions it spends until the end of its next turn.

**Réussite** The creature is unaffected.

**Échec** The creature becomes frightened 2 before taking its action or reaction.

**Échec critique** The creature becomes frightened 2 and its action or reaction fails and is wasted.

You can target up to 5 creatures. If a creature spends an action or reaction that affects multiple targets simultaneously, it needs to attempt only one save against mask of terror.

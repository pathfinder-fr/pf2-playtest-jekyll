A weapon made of pure magical force manifests and attacks foes you designate within range. This weapon is ghostly and appears as your deity’s favored weapon. When you cast the spell, the weapon appears next to a foe of your choice within range and makes a Strike against it. Each time you Concentrate on the Spell, you can move the weapon to a new target within range (if you choose to do so) and make a Strike with it. The spiritual weapon uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Attacks with the weapon use your attack modifier with that type of weapon, but substitute your spellcasting ability modifier instead of the normal ability modifier. Regardless of its appearance, the weapon deals force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. When you Strike with the weapon, you can deal damage of the normal damage type of the weapon instead of force damage (or any of the available damage types for a versatile weapon). No other attributes of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. A spiritual weapon counts as a weapon for triggers, resistances, and so forth. The weapon doesn’t take up space, grant flanking, or have any other attributes a creature would. The weapon can’t make any kind of attack other than a normal Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons do not apply to this weapon.

---
A disk of magical energy materializes adjacent to you. This disk is 2 feet in diameter and follows 5 feet behind you automatically, floating just above the ground. It holds up to 5 Bulk of objects (though they must be able to fit and balance on its surface). Any objects atop a floating disk fall to the ground when the spell ends. The disk is dismissed if a creature tries to ride atop it, if anyone tries to lift or force the disk higher above the ground, or if you move more than 30 feet away from the disk (such as by Flying or Climbing above the ground).

summary: '..'
---
You prepare a spell to trigger later. While casting contingency, you also cast another spell of 4th level or lower with a casting time of no more than three actions. You must pay any appropriate costs for the spell. This companion spell must be one that can affect you. You must make any decisions for the spell when you set the contingency, such as choosing damage type for resist energy. During the casting, choose a trigger under which the spell will be cast, using the same restrictions as the trigger for a readied action. You can cause the companion spell to come into effect as a reaction with that trigger. It affects only you, even if it would normally affect more creatures. If you define complicated conditions, as determined by the GM, the trigger might fail. If you cast contingency, the newer one supersedes the older.

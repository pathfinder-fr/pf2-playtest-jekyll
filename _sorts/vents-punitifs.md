Violent winds and a powerful downdraft fill the area, forming a cyclone. All flying creatures in the area descend 40 feet. The entire area is greater difficult terrain for flying and difficult terrain for creatures on the ground or climbing. Any creature that ends its turn flying within the area descends 20 feet. Any creature pushed into a surface by this spell’s winds takes falling damage. The squares at the outside vertical edges of the cylinder prevent creatures from leaving. They’re greater difficult terrain, and any creature attempting to push through must succeed at an Athletics check (or Flying Maneuver) against your spell DC to get through. A creature that fails ends its current action but can try again.

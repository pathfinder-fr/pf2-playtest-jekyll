A cloak of swirling colors shrouds the target. Creatures are dazzled while adjacent to it, and attacks cause a brilliant flash of light. When a creature hits the target with a melee attack, it must attempt a Will save. It's bolstered until the end of its next turn.

**Réussite** The attacker is unaffected.

**Échec** The attacker is blinded for 1 round.

**Échec critique** The attacker is stunned for 1 round.

You see things within 30 feet as they truly are. The GM attempts a special secret dispel check against any illusion in the area, but only for the purpose of determining whether you see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against an illusory disguise spell, you see the creature’s true form but it doesn’t end the illusory disguise).

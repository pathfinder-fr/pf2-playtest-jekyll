Make a dispel attempt against the target (see page 197). If you succeed against a spell effect, you dispel it. If you succeed against a magic item, the item becomes a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes. This doesn’t change the item’s quality. If the target is an artifact or similar item, you automatically fail.

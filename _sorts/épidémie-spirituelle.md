You lay a curse on the target, sapping its spirit and leaving a contagious trap in its spiritual essence for those who contact it. The results depend on the target’s Will save. Any creature that casts a divine or occult spell on the target while it’s affected must also attempt a Will save as if targeted, and the curse continues to spread in this way.

**Réussite** Enfeebled 2 for 1 round.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** Enfeebled 2 for 1 minute, enfeebled 1 permanently.

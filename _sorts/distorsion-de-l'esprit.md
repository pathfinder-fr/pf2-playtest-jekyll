The target’s mind is thrown into confusion, depending on its Will saving throw. The effect of warp mind is instantaneous and therefore can’t be dispelled until it runs its course, though it can be counteracted by alter reality, miracle, primal phenomenon, restoration, or wish.

**Réussite** The target is confused for 1 round.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target is confused for 1 minute.

**Échec critique** The target is confused permanently.

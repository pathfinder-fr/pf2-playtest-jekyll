You transform into a Large dragon battle form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. You count as a dragon in addition to your normal traits. Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate it. When you transform, you gain the following:

- Blindsense 60 feet and darkvision.

- Athletics bonus of +20 unless your own bonus is higher.

- AC 27 (TAC 24), ignore armor’s check penalty and reduced Speed.

- 10 temporary Hit Points while you have the form.

- Resistance 10 against the damage type of your breath weapon.

- Speed 40 feet and fly Speed 100 feet.

- One or more natural melee attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You’re trained with them. Your attack modifier is +20 and your damage bonus is +6. These are Strength based (for the purposes of enfeebled, for example).

- You can activate a breath weapon by spending 2 actions. A creature that succeeds at a DC 24 saving throw takes half damage, or no damage on a critical success. The saving throw is a Reflex save unless stated otherwise in the special ability description below. Once activated, your breath weapon can’t be used again for 1d4 rounds. Your breath weapon is an arcane evocation with the appropriate damage trait. The shape, damage, and damage type depend on your specific dragon form (see below). These special statistics can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents casting spells or taking most actions with the manipulate trait that require hands (the GM decides if there’s doubt). You can dismiss the spell with an action (this action has the concentrate trait). If you prepare this spell, choose from the following options. When in battle form, you gain the attacks, movement types, and special abilities listed below for the corresponding form.

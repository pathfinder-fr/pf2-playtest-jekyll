---
The target is stricken by intense paranoia towards all creatures around it, with effects determined by the outcome of its Will saving throw.

**Réussite** The target believes everyone it sees is a potential threat. It becomes unfriendly to all creatures that were previously allies, treating only itself as an ally. The spell ends after 1 round.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** Per success, but the effect lasts the full minute.

**Échec critique** Per failure, except the target believes that everyone it sees is a mortal enemy. It uses its reactions and free actions against these enemies regardless of whether they were previously its allies, as determined by the GM. It otherwise acts as rationally as normal and will likely prefer to attack enemies that are actively attacking or hindering it.

You create a pattern of shifting colors that hovers in the air. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, when it enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently fascinated by the pattern doesn’t need to attempt new saves.

**Réussite** Unaffected.

**Échec** The target is fascinated by the pattern.

**Échec critique** The target is fascinated by the pattern. While it remains fascinated, it can’t take reactions.

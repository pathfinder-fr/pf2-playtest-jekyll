summary: '..'

Your eyes glow as you sense aligned auras. Choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. You detect auras of that alignment. You receive no information beyond presence or absence. You can choose not to detect creatures or effects you're aware have that alignment. Only divine spellcasters, undead, and beings from the Outer Sphere have an alignment aura if they are 6th level or higher.

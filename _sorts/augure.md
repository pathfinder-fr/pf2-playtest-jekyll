You ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future, and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes.

- Weal The results will be good.

- Woe The results will be bad.

- Weal and Woe The results will be a mix of good and bad.

- Nothing There won't be particularly good or bad results. The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result is always ""nothing."" This makes it impossible to tell whether a ""nothing"" result is accurate. If anyone casts augury on the same topic, use the secret roll result from the first casting. It's possible to get a different result if circumstances change.

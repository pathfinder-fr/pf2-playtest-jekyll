You create an illusion that makes a surface appear hazardous. Any surface in that area (typically the ground) is filled with illusory hazards. Any creature moving through the illusion treats the squares as difficult terrain. A creature can attempt a Seek action to disbelieve the effect (see page 194). If it succeeds, it ignores the effect for the remaining duration. Casting warped terrain again ends any previous warped terrain you created.

You can make the warped terrain appear in the air rather than on a surface, causing it to function as difficult terrain for flying creatures.

All living targets regain Hit Points equal to 9d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, you return any number of dead targets to life temporarily, with the same effects as raise dead and the same limitations. The resurrected creatures have a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the amount of healing you gave living creatures (instead of having full HP). The revived creatures can’t regain Hit Points, and once revival’s duration ends, they lose all temporary Hit Points and die. Revival can’t resurrect creatures killed by disintegrate or a death effect. It has no effect on undead.

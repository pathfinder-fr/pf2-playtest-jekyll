summary: '..'
---
You send the target back to its home plane, to the place it was before leaving. The effect depends on the target's Will save. You can add a Material Casting action to give the creature a –2 circumstance penalty to its save. The component must be a specially gathered object that is anathema to the creature, not from a spell component pouch. You can cast this spell only when you're on your home plane.

**Réussite** The creature resists being banished.

**Réussite critique** The creature resists being banished and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.

**Échec** The creature is banished.

crit-**Échec** The creature is banished and can't return to your home plane by any means for 1 week.

Heightened

9th

You can target up to 10 creatures. The extra material component affects these targets if it is anathema to them.

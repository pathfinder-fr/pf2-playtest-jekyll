You transform into a Large animal battle form. You must have space to expand or the spell is lost. You count as an animal in addition to your normal traits. Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can’t activate it. When you transform, you gain the following:

- AC 25 (TAC 22), ignore armor’s check penalty and reduced Speed.

- One or more natural melee attacks, which are the only types of attacks you can use. You’re trained with them. Your attack modifier is +14; your damage bonus is +9. These are Strength based.

- 15 temporary Hit Points while you have the form.

- Low-light vision and scent.

- Athletics bonus of +14 unless your own bonus is higher. These special statistics can be adjusted only by penalties, circumstance bonuses, and conditional bonuses. Your battle form prevents casting spells, speaking, or using most actions with the manipulate trait that require hands (the GM decides if there’s doubt). You can dismiss the spell with a concentrate action. If you prepare this spell, choose from the following options. You gain the attacks, Speeds, and special abilities listed. You can choose the specific type of animal (such as allosaurus instead of tyrannosaurus). This has no effect on size or statistics.

Ankylosaurus

Speed 25 feet; +1 conditional bonus to AC, but not TAC; tail (backswing, reach 10 feet), Damage 2d6 bludgeoning; foot, Damage 2d6 bludgeoning.

Brachiosaurus

Stegosaurus

Speed 30 feet; tail (reach 10), Damage 2d8 piercing.

Triceratops

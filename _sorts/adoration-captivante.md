You become entrancingly beautiful and desirable, and creatures are distracted by their feelings for you as long as they remain within the area. The effect is determined by their Will saves. If a creature leaves and reenters, use the original save results.

**Réussite** The creature takes a –1 conditional penalty to Perception and skill checks not directed at you.

**Réussite critique** The creature is unaffected.

**Échec** The creature is fascinated.

**Échec critique** The creature is fascinated and its attitude toward you improves by one step.

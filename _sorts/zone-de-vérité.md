Creatures within the area or those entering it have difficulty lying, depending on their Will saves. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the area. It keeps the results of this initial save if it leaves and reenters the area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they can avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they might be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth.

**Réussite** The target takes a –1 conditional penalty to Deception checks.

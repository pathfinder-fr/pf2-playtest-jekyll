Your Somatic Casting action for this spell is to hold your weapon aloft and charge it with magical energy, so you can use the Somatic Casting action even if you don’t have a hand free. On your next attack with that weapon before the start of your next turn, increase the item bonus of your weapon by 1 (minimum +1 and maximum +5). This adds an additional die of damage as is normal for magic weapons.

You snuff out a creature at the brink of death, based on its Will save. If this kills it, you gain 10 temporary HP and a +1 conditional bonus to attack and damage rolls for 10 minutes.

**Réussite** The target increases its dying value by 1.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target dies.

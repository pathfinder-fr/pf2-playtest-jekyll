You create a pattern of lights in the air that pulses with intense light. Creatures are dazzled while inside the pattern. A creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it’s inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently blinded by the pattern doesn’t need to attempt new saving throws.

**Réussite** Unaffected.

**Échec** The target is blinded by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it gets a new save to recover from the blindness at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.

**Échec critique** The target is blinded for 1 minute.

You teleport the targets to new positions within the area. The creature must be able to fit, and the position must be unoccupied, entirely within the area, and in your line of sight. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save.

**Réussite** The target is unaffected.

**Réussite critique** The target can choose to teleport, but it chooses the destination.

**Échec** You teleport the target and choose its destination.

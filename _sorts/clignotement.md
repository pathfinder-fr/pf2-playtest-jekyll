You blink quickly between the Material and Ethereal Planes. You gain resistance 5 to all damage (overcome by force). You can Concentrate on the Spell to vanish and reappear 10 feet in a random direction determined by the GM; the movement doesn't trigger reactions. At the end of your turn, you vanish and reappear as above.

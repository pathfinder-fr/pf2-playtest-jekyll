Any scrying spell sees, hears, smells, and otherwise detects whatever you wish within the area, rather than what is actually in the area. You can Concentrate on the Spell each round to change the illusion as you desire, including playing out a complex scene. If the scrying spell is of a higher level than false vision, you can attempt a Perception check to disbelieve the illusion, though even if you’re successful, you can’t learn what’s truly going on in the area.

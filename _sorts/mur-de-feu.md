You create either a 5-foot-thick, 60-foot-long, 10-foot-high wall of flame in a straight line or a 5-foot-thick, 10-foot-radius ring of flame. The wall stands vertically in either form if you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or height. Everything on each side of the wall is concealed from creatures on the opposite side. Any creature crossing the wall or occupying the wall’s area at the start of its turn takes 3d6 fire damage.

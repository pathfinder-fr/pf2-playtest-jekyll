You create a shimmering barrier that attempts to dispel all teleportation effects and planar travel into or out of the area, including items that allow access to extradimensional spaces (such as a bag of holding). Dimensional lock dispels any attempt to summon a creature into the area but doesn't stop the creature from departing when the summoning ends.

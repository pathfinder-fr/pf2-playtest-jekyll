The target makes no sound, preventing creatures from noticing it using hearing. The target canâ€™t use sonic attacks, nor can it use actions with the auditory trait. (This prevents it from casting spells that include Verbal Casting actions.)

The silence effect emanates from the touched creature, silencing all sound in or passing through a 10-foot radius and preventing any auditory and sonic effects in the affected area. While within the radius, creatures are subject to the effects listed above. Depending upon the position of the effect, a creature might be able to notice the lack of sound reaching it. For example, if the silence effect blocks a corridor leading to a noisy party, a creature might notice those sounds abruptly cease.

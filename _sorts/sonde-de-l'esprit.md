You access the target’s memories and knowledge unless it fends you off with a Will save.

**Réussite** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** Each round of the probe’s duration, you ask a different question and attempt to uncover the answer. For each question, the target can attempt a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don’t learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target sends you a false answer that you believe is a truthful answer.

**Échec critique** Per failure, but the target takes a –4 circumstance penalty to Deception checks against questions you ask as part of the probe.

Blades of force form a churning wall. The wall is a straight line 20 feet high, 120 feet long, and 2 inches thick and provides cover. You deal 6d8 force damage to each creature in its space when the wall is created, that attempts to pass through the wall, or that ends its turn inside the wall; the creature must attempt a Reflex save. A creature that succeeds when the wall is created is pushed to the nearest space on the side of its choice.

**Réussite** The creature takes half damage.

**Réussite critique** The creature is unaffected.

**Échec** The creature takes full damage.

**Échec critique** The creature takes double damage. If it was trying to move through, it fails but can try again with later actions.

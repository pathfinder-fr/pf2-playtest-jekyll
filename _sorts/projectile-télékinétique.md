summary: '..'
---
You hurl a loose, unattended object in range at the target. The spell gains the trait of a damage type appropriate to the object (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). Make a ranged attack against the target. If you hit, you deal 1d10 damage of the given type; you deal double damage on a critical hit. No special traits or magic properties of the hurled item affect the attack or damage. You can heighten the spell to hurl more objects, though you attempt only one attack roll and target only one creature, and your salvo of projectiles deals damage all at once for the purposes of resistances, weaknesses, and the like. Only one damage type applies regardless of how many objects you hurl.

**Réussite** Full damage.

**Réussite critique** Double damage.

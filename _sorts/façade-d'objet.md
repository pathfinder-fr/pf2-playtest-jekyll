---
You make the target object look and feel as though it were in much better or worse shape. When you cast this spell, decide whether you want to make the object look decrepit or perfect. An item made to look decrepit appears broken and of poor quality. Metal looks rusted, wood looks dried out and cracked, and so on. An intact item made to look better appears as though its quality were one step better, brand new, and highly polished or well maintained. A broken item appears to be intact and functional. Destroyed items can’t be affected by this spell. A creature who Interacts with the item get a chance to disbelieve the illusion.

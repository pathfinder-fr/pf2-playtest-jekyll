Add one Somatic Casting action to the triggering spell. Its target gains a +1 conditional bonus to saves as long as the spell lasts and as long as you Concentrate on the Spell, to a maximum of 1 minute. If the original spell already requires concentration, you can maintain the conditional bonus with the same action.

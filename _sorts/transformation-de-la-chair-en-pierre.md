You attempt to turn the target’s flesh into stone. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

**Réussite** The target is slowed 1 for 1 round.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target is slowed 1 and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, the slowed condition increases by 1; on a critically failed save, it increases by 2. A successful save reduces the slowed condition by 1. If the slowed condition is reduced to 0 or otherwise ends, the spell ends. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from flesh to stone, the spell ends but the creature is petrified permanently.

**Échec critique** As failure, but the creature is initially slowed 2.

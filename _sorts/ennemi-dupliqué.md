You try to create a temporary duplicate of an enemy. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to disrupt the spell. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target and has the target’s attack modifier, AC, saving throw modifiers, Perception, and skill modifiers, but it has only 70 Hit Points and lacks the target’s special abilities, including immunities, resistances, and weaknesses. It has no magic items except weapon potency runes. The duplicate gains the minion trait, and it can only Stride and Strike. Its Strikes deal the target’s normal damage but don’t apply added effects, since it doesn’t have special abilities. The spell automatically ends if its HP drop to 0. The duplicate attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities. You can attempt to command it as if you used Command a Minion as part of your action to Concentrate on the Spell, but the GM determines whether the creature follows your command. The duplicate is imperfect, so each turn after it takes its actions, it loses 8d6 Hit Points. It’s not a living creature, and it can never regain its lost Hit Points in any way.

**Réussite** The duplicate deals half damage with its Strikes and is destroyed at the end of the second round after it takes actions.

**Réussite critique** You fail to create a duplicate.

**Échec** The duplicate works as described.

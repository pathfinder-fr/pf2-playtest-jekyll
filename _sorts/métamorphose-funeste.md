You attempt to transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.

**Réussite** The target's body gains minor features of the harmless animal. Its insides churn, causing it to be sick 1. When it recovers from the sickness, its features revert to normal.

**Réussite critique** The target is unaffected.

**Échec** The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. It can spend all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original form, granting it a Will save to end the effect.

**Échec critique** The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and mind, for 1 day.

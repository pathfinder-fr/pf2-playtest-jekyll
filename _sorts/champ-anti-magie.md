Spells can't penetrate the area, magic items cease to function within it, and no one inside can cast spells or use magic abilities. Likewise, spells—such as dispel magic—can't affect the field itself unless they are of a higher level. Magic effects resume the moment they pass outside the field. For example, a ray fired from one side of the field could target a creature on the other side (as long as caster and target are outside). A summoned creature winks out of existence but reappears if the field moves or ends. Invested magic items cease to function, but they remain invested and function when the item exits; the ability boost from a potent item isn't suppressed. Spells of a higher level than the antimagic field overcome its effects, and can even be cast by a creature within the field. The field disrupts only magic, so a +3 longsword still functions as a master-quality longsword. Magically created creatures (such as golems) function normally within an antimagic field.

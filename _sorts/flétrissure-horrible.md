summary: '..'
---
You pull the moisture from the targets’ bodies, dealing 9d10 negative damage. Each target must attempt a Fortitude save to avoid withering in this fashion. Creatures made of water (such as water elementals) and plant creatures automatically treat their outcomes as one degree of success worse. Creatures whose bodies contain no significant moisture (such as earth elementals) are immune to horrid wilting.

**Réussite** Half damage.

**Réussite critique** No damage.

**Échec** Full damage.

**Échec critique** Double damage.

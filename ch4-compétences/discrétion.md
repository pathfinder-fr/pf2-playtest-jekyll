L'errata suivant concerne le chapitre sur les compétences.
Page 158—In the Sneak action of the Stealth skill, in the
third paragraph, in the first sentence, change “at any time
during your movement” to “at the end of the Sneak action”.
After the third sentence, add the following: “If you succeed at
your Stealth check and then attempt to Strike a creature, the
creature remains flat-footed against that attack, and then you
become seen.” Remove the last sentence of that paragraph.
